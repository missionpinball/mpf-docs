The RGB.DMD controller was designed as a variant to the SmartMatrix that would
be capable of both controlling RGB LED panels and accepting and decoding the
DMD signal from an existing commercial pinball machine. As soon as RGB LED
panels with spacing matching that of a DMD became available in September of
2015, Eli worked with the MPF developers to modify the SmartMatrix software
and make it possible to stream color DMD images from MPF to SmartMatrix and
RGB.DMD displays so that MPF machines can have color displays in the
traditional 32x128 DMD form factor.

It's likely that no one would be using RGB LED DMDs
if it wasn't for the efforts of Eli Curtz.
Eli first posted about these types of panels in the P-ROC forum (now defunct) in 2014.
At that time we could only find panels with 3mm spacing between pixels which
was a bit larger than traditional pinball DMDs, but that's what kicked
off the conversation about, "Whoa, maybe we could use these for 'real'
color DMDs some day." Then in September 2015, Eli posted again telling
us that we could now get panels with 2.5mm spacing which is the
perfect size we need. Eli also showed us how to connect them and what
software we needed to make everything work. So really everything here
is because of Eli. All we did is take everything he showed us and
write it down. (Well, that and we also created the interface for MPF,
but that was the easy part.) So thanks Eli!

The Eagle files are available along with the code for those who'd like to build their own
`RGB.DMD board <https://github.com/ecurtz/RGB_DMD>`_. Connect your panels and you are good to go.

In MPF, RGB.DMD works just like :doc:`/hardware/smartmatrix/index` (go there for details).
Can copy the following example (and replace ``com12`` with your com port):

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    hardware:
        rgb_dmd: smartmatrix

    smartmatrix:
        smartmatrix_1:
           port: com12
           baud: 3000000
           old_cookie: false

    rgb_dmds:
      smartmatrix_1:
         platform: smartmatrix
         source_display: dmd
