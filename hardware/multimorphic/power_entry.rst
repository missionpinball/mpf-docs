Power Entry Board
=================

This board can be used to fan out your power rails.
See :doc:`/hardware/voltages_and_power/index` for details.

The Multimorphic Power Filter board serves four purposes.
1. It serves as a central connection point for 230V/110V AC 
and all your PSUs using connectors J1, J2 or J3.
2. It provides a bank of capacitors to buffer current surges
on the high voltage rail.
3. It provides safety relay control of the high voltage rail.
4. It connects the ground (negative) terminals of each of
the power supplies to prevent a differential in ground 
levels between the coil supply and the logic supply which is 
a common cause of unstable operation. 

The Multimorphic Power Entry Board allows connections for
up to four DC rails:

* 5V
* 12V
* 15V
* High Voltage (HV)

You might use different voltages but the LEDs might operate outside the spec
in this case (consult the manual).

DC Outputs are J11 to J17. DC Inputs are J6 to J9.
J10 will turn on HV on the ouput.
You should connect it to your door switch to cut high power when the door is
opened.
Make sure that J10 is closed during development or HV will be off.
