Starting with PD-LED v3 you can configure up to twelve steppers on a PD-LED.

To enable servos you need to configure your PD-LED board in your ``p_roc``
section.
Assuming your PD-LED has the ID 4 you can use the following config to enable
all servos and and define two of them:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   p_roc:
     pd_led_boards:
       4:
         max_servo_value: 300 # rougly maps to 2ms.       
         use_servo_0: True
         use_servo_1: True
         use_servo_2: True
         use_servo_3: True
         use_servo_4: True
         use_servo_5: True
         use_servo_6: True
         use_servo_7: True
         use_servo_8: True
         use_servo_9: True
         use_servo_10: True
         use_servo_11: True

   servos:
      servos_4_0:
         number: 4-0
      servos_4_1:
         number: 4-1

The number of your servos has to be ``id_of_your_ped_led-number``.
In this case ``4-0`` and ``4-1`` for the first and second servo on PD-LED 4.
You will not be able to use LED 72 to LED 83 on the PD-LED when enabling all
servos.

max_servo_value determines the width of the pulses sent to the servo.  This value 
can be altered to increase of decrease the servo arc within the physical limits
of the device. Higher values widen pulsewidth increasing the range of motion.

DIP switch 6 of the PD-LED controls the default state of the LED outputs when the
board first receives power. Because servos receive signal from LED outputs, 
placing this DIP switch in the on position can activate a servo prior to the
PD-LED receiving instructions from the controller and MPF. This in turn may
lead to a servo thermal overload state and failure. When using servos, 
DIP switch 6 should be maintained in the OFF position.

You should hook up your servos to an external power source (usually 5V) and
not draw that power from the PD-LED.
However, make sure to connect the ground of your power supply.
See :doc:`/hardware/voltages_and_power/voltages_and_power` for details.
