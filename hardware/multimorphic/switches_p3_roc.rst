To configure switches on a P3-ROC, you can follow the guides and instructions
in the :doc:`/mechs/switches/index` docs.

However there are a few things to know about using switches with a P3-ROC.

number:
-------

Unlike the P-ROC, the P3-ROC does not have switch inputs on the P3-ROC itself.
Instead, you add SW-16 boards which each have 16 direct switch inputs. (e.g.
there is no switch matrix.) You can connect up to 16 SW-16s to support as many
as 256 switches.

Each SW-16 has a unique ``board number`` which is set using DIP switches
(find that out now).
On each board there are two ``banks`` (A and B) of 8 switches.
Then each switch has an ``input number`` (0 to 7).

To configure the ``number:`` of a switch connected to an SW-16 board and a
P3-ROC, you have two options:

Board Bank Switch Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first (and easier) option is to enter the number as a combination of the
SW-16 ``board address`` (0-15, as configured by the DIP switches), then the
``bank number`` (Bank A is 0, Bank B is 1), then the switch ``input number``
(0-7).

For example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      my_switch:
         number: A0-B0-0  # SW-16 board at address 0, Bank A, Switch 0
      my_other_switch:
         number: A2-B1-5  # SW-16 board at address 2, Bank B, Switch 5

Direct Numbering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also use the internal number.
As mentioned in the SW-16 manual you can calculate those using:

``Bank A switch: P3-ROC switch # = SW-16 address * 16 + Bank A switch input``
``Bank B switch: P3-ROC switch # = SW-16 address * 16 + 8 + Bank B switch input``

However, we recommend the above syntax because it will perform this calcuation
for you.

For example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      my_switch:
         number: 0   # SW-16 board at address 0, Bank A, Switch 0
      my_other_switch:
         number: 45  # SW-16 board at address 2, Bank B, Switch 5

Burst Switch Inputs
-------------------

Burst switch inputs (J3 to J10) on the P3-Roc can be used in two ways in MPF.

* Burst Optos - As burst switch inputs in combination with a burst switcher driver can drive long-beam optos.
  This is how they were originally intended.
* Local Inputs - Alternatively you can use them as direct local inputs (and the burst drivers as outputs;
  see :doc:`drivers` section for details).

Burst Switches as Burst Optos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure burst optos using the following syntax:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      burst_opto_1_20:
         number: burst-1-20   # burst input with switch 1 and driver 20
      burst_opto_2_20:
         number: burst-2-20   # burst input with switch 2 and driver 20
      burst_opto_10_5:
         number: burst-10-5   # burst input with switch 10 and driver 5

Make sure to disable DIP switches 1 and 2 on the P3-Roc.
You can configure up to five switches per driver.

.. note::

   There is currently no reliable way to read the initial state of burst optos.
   MPF will assume that all burst IRs are open on start-up. This might cause
   if you use it to track balls in a ball lock which might contain balls from
   a previous game. This limitation will probably go away in future firmware
   update of the P3-Roc.

Burst Opto PCBs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Burst optos are unlike normal :doc:`/mechs/switches/optos` and you cannot
use normal optos.
Instead, they use 40kHz infrared transmitters and receivers.
Multimorphic sells them as single transmitter/receiver (part number:
PCBA-0011-0002) and as bank of 8 (part number: PCBA-0003-0003).

Burst Switches as Local Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use burst switches as local inputs set DIP switch 2 to ``on`` on the P3-Roc.
You can use those 64 inputs as direct inputs:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      local_switch0:
         number: direct-0     # local input 0
      local_switch20:
         number: direct-20    # local input 20

Make sure to assign IDs >= 4 to all SW-16 boards if you set DIP 2.
Local switches behave just like any other switch on the P3-Roc.
Hardware rules, debouncing etc. will behave exactly the same way.

.. note::

   You need at least Firmware version 2.6 to use burst switches as local inputs
   on the P3-Roc.


.. warning::

   There is no electronic protection on the P3-Roc for burst switches (neither as local inputs nor as burst optos).
   Do not use them without additional protection.
   Any voltage above 3.3V or below 0V will irrevisibly damage the P3-Roc.
   Make sure you know what you are doing before turning this on.
   We advise to use SW-16 for normal playfield/mech inputs and only use local inputs with additional
   circuits (not directly).
   If you plan to use burst optos have a look at the PCBs offered from Multimorphic for that purpose.


Debounce options
----------------

The P-ROC has the ability to configure :doc:`debounce settings </mechs/switches/debounce>`
for switches. A non-debounced switch which report its state change immediately,
while a debounced switch will report its state change after it's been in the
new state for two consecutive reads.

By default, MPF will enable debouncing in both directions (open and close) for
all switches. However you can override this on a per-switch basis with a
switch's ``debounce:`` setting.

Valid options are ``normal``, ``quick``, and ``auto``.

To disable debouncing for a switch, add ``debounce: quick`` to the switch
config, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      my_switch:
         number: A0-B0-0
         debounce: quick

To force debouncing to always be used (which is also the default on the P-ROC,
so not really needed), configure it like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      my_switch:
         number: A0-B0-0
         debounce: normal
