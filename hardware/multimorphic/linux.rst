How to install P-ROC / P3-ROC drivers on Linux
==============================================

If you want to use MPF on a Debian-based version of Linux (which includes
Ubuntu), you can use our all-in-one Debian installer which is detailed in the
:doc:`/install/linux/index` guide.

Note that when you run that installation script, it will ask you what type
of hardware you'll be using. If you choose the "P3 or P-ROC" option, then it
will install all of the libraries and drivers you need, and everything should
work.

After that, you can continue on with the :doc:`platform` documentation to
finish your MPF configuration for the P-ROC/P3-ROC.
