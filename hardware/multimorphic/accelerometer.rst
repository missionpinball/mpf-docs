THe P3-ROC includes an accelerometer which you can use with MPF to detect
g-force changes (to use as a tilt) as well as 3-axis leveling (to use to
determine whether the machine is level).

To use the accelerometer on the P3-ROC, add it to your machine-wide config file
like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   accelerometers:
       p3_roc_accelerometer:
           number: 1

The name (which is "p3_roc_accelerometer" in the example above) doesn't really
matter.

Other than that, use it like you would any accelerometer in MPF, by following
the docs and guides in the :doc:`/mechs/accelerometers/index` section of the
documentation.
