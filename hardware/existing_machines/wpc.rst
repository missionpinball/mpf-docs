How to use MPF with WPC machines
================================

You can use MPF to control existing Williams / Bally / Midway WPC, WPC-S, and WPC-95 pinball machines.

1. Connecting the physical hardware
-----------------------------------

The main options for pinball controller hardware is the :doc:`Multimorphic P-ROC </hardware/multimorphic/index>`
(not the P3-ROC). FAST has a WPC controller too but it never hit general availability.
The people who created the :doc:`LISY boards </hardware/lisy/index>` are also working on a "LISY35" board for
Bally/WPC machines with AS-2518-17 or AS-2518-35 CPU boards.

In both cases, you remove the existing MPU board from the backbox of your machine and replace it with the
new controller. You then connect up all the existing cables and connectors to the new controller, so in
effect the P-ROC or FAST WPC controller becomes the new MPU of your machine.

A few notes:

* Both the P-ROC and the FAST WPC controller have USB connections on them, and the actual "code" that
  makes up MPF runs on a computer which remotely controls the pinball controller (and therefore the machine)
* Switch connectors are connected directly to the P-ROC or FAST WPC controller.
* Drivers, coils, lamps, and GI are controlled via the existing WPC power driver board (which is connected
  to the P-ROC or FAST WPC controller via the existing 34-pin ribbon cable).
* The existing WPC sound board in the backbox is not used, as sounds are generated via the computer running
  MPF. There are articles online showing how you can modify the existing sound board to add a headphone plug
  you can connect into the computer running MPF, though most people end up replacing the speakers with new
  ones and a more powerful and better sounding amp. This means you can remove the existing sound board from
  the backbox.
* The existing DMD, if you choose to use it, is unplugged from the WPC DMD driver board and instead plugged
  into a 14-pin header on the P-ROC or FAST WPC controller. This means you can remove the existing DMD
  driver board from the backbox.

For the P-Roc connect your machine according to the
`P-Roc connector mappings <https://www.multimorphic.com/content/uploads/2017/08/P-ROC_Connector_Mappings_v2.pdf>`_.

More technical information can be found in the
`PinWiki Williams WPC <http://www.pinwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Williams_WPC>`_ page.


2. Configuring MPF for WPC machines
-----------------------------------

In order to use MPF in a WPC machine, you need to configure the ``driverboards:`` section of your ``hardware:``
config for MPF.

If you're using a FAST WPC controller, it will look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   hardware:
      platform: fast
      driverboards: wpc

And if you're using a P-ROC:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   hardware:
      platform: p_roc
      driverboards: wpc

Note that with the P-ROC, it is *very important* that you specify ``driverboards: wpc`` in your config if you're
using a WPC machine. The reason for this is the P-ROC can be used to control either PD-16 (the P-ROC driver boards)
or WPC driver boards, but the polarity of each type is the inverse of the other.

In other words, if you put a P-ROC in a WPC machine but specify ``driverboards: pdb``, when you run MPF, it will
disable all the drivers, but since the polarity is reversed, it will actually enable every driver in your machine
at once. This will (1) be very loud and cause you to jump back about 10 feet, and (2) blow all your fuses.

3. Configuring switches
-----------------------

When using MPF with WPC machines, you can use the switch numbers from the machine's operator's manual. The exact
format depends on the type of switch:

Matrix switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matrix switches start with the letter ``S``, followed by the switch number. For example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      s_left_slingshot:
         number: s41
      s_right_jet:
         number: S45

Note that the "S" is not case-sensitive.

Switch numbers in WPC machines correspond to the column and row, so switch "11"
is column 1, row 1, switch "26" is column 2, row 6, etc. This means that there
are no 0s or 9s in a standard 8x8 switch matrix.

Also, some WPC-95 machines have a 9th column in the switch matrix (meaning they'll
have switch numbers 91-98). In this case, just enter those switch numbers like
normal, and MPF will notice that there are switch numbers in the 90s and
automatically configure the controller hardware to use the 9th column.

Our experience with using MPF with many different WPC machines is that many times, the
switch numbers in the operator's manual are incorrect. (We see this in many 25% of
WPC machines.) Usually it's the case where two switches have been swapped, though
sometimes there are unused switches that really are used and vice-versa. So if you
don't get switch activities that you expect, check out neighboring switches to see
if the numbers are wrong.

Direct switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Direct switches (which are typically the coin and front door switches) are
entered with the ``SD`` prefix, then the number, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      s_left_coin:
         number: sd1
      s_enter:
         number: SD8

Again, case doesn't matter.

Fliptronics switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fliptronics switches (on machines that have them) are entered with the ``SF`` prefix.

There are 8 Fliptronics switches on machines with Fliptronics. Typically four of
them are used for flipper buttons, and four are used for EOS switches. (The flipper
buttons on most Fliptronics machines actually have two switches stacked together behind
each flipper button. If you push the flipper button part way in, the switch
connected to the lower flipper engages, and if you push the button the rest of
the way in, the switch connected to the upper flipper engages. This means if
you're good, it's technically possible to flip just the lower flipper without
flipping the upper one (or it's possible to hold a ball on the lower flipper
while flipping the upper one).

That said, some machines needed a few extra switches for other things, and if
they don't have four flippers, it's possible that the extra Fliptronics
switches are used for other things.

You would use Fliptronics switches in your config like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
     s_flipper_lower_right_eos:
       number: sf1
     s_flipper_lower_right:
       number: sf2
       tags: player, right_flipper
     s_flipper_lower_left_eos:
       number: sf3
     s_flipper_lower_left:
       number: sf4
       tags: player, left_flipper

4. Configuring coils & drivers
------------------------------

The drivers section of your WPC machine's operators manual will list all the
driver numbers as well as the devices they're attached to. Note that WPC machines
use drivers for coils, motors, and flashers. You only enter your coils and
motors in the ``coils:`` section of your config. Flashers go in the ``flashers:``
section (discussed below).

Configuring regular coils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure the regular coils (from the "Solenoid / Flasher" table in your
machine's operator's manual, enter the letter ``C`` followed by the solenoid
number, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   coils:
     c_trough_eject:
       number: c01
       default_pulse_ms: 25
     c_bottom_popper:
       number: c02
       default_pulse_ms: 25
     c_plunger_lane:
       number: c03
       default_pulse_ms: 25

Fliptronics coils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll also see a section in the solenoid table in your ooperator's manual with "Flipper
Circuits", like this:

.. image:: /hardware/images/flipper_circuits.jpg

That section shows the 8 driver outputs that are connected to the Fliptronics
board (if your machine has one).

For those coil numbers, you can either enter ``C`` followed by the number, or
the four-letter code indicating which output the driver is connected to, like
this:

* ``c29`` or ``FLRM`` - Lower Right Main (Power)
* ``c30`` or ``FLRH`` - Lower Right Hold
* ``c31`` or ``FLLM`` - Lower Left Main (Power)
* ``c32`` or ``FLLH`` - Lower Left Hold
* ``c33`` or ``FURM`` - Upper Right Main (Power)
* ``c34`` or ``FURH`` - Upper Right Hold
* ``s35`` or ``FULM`` - Upper Left Main (Power)
* ``s36`` or ``FULH`` - Upper Left Hold

Many machines do not use all eight of these, and many machines also connect
Fliptronics coils up to other random things (typically magnets and diverters).

An example in your config might be:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   coils:
     c_flipper_left_main:
       number: fllm
       default_pulse_ms: 30
     c_flipper_left_hold:
       number: fllh
       allow_enable: true
     c_flipper_right_main:
       number: flrm
       default_pulse_ms: 30
     c_flipper_right_hold:
       number: flrh
       allow_enable: true
     c_vanish_magnet:
       number: c35
       allow_enable: true
     c_loop_post_diverter:
       number: c36
       allow_enable: true

5. Configuring lights (lamps)
-----------------------------
Lights are configured with the letter ``L`` followed by the lamp number from the
manual:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   lights:
     l_ball_save:
       number: l11
       subtype: matrix
     l_fortress_multiball:
       number: L12
       subtype: matrix
     l_museum_multiball:
       number: L13
       subtype: matrix
     l_cryoprison_multiball:
       number: l14
       subtype: matrix
     l_wasteland_multiball:
       number: L15
       subtype: matrix
     l_shoot_again:
       number: l16
       subtype: matrix

See :doc:`/config/lights` and :doc:`/config/light_player` for details on how to use them.

5. Configuring GI (general illumination)
----------------------------------------

GI strings are configured with ``G`` followed by the number, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   lights:
     gi_back_panel:
       number: g01
       subtype: gi
     gi_upper_right:
       number: g02
       subtype: gi
     gi_upper_left:
       number: g03
       subtype: gi
     gi_lower_right:
       number: g04
       subtype: gi
     gi_lower_left:
       number: g05
       subtype: gi

See :doc:`/config/lights` and :doc:`/config/light_player` for details on how to use them.

6. Configuring flashers
-----------------------

Since flashers in WPC machines are technically drivers (coils), they are also
configured with the letter ``C`` followed by their number similar to ``coils``.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   coils:
     f_claw:
       number: c17
     f_jets:
       number: c21
     f_side_ramp:
       number: c22
     f_left_ramp_upper:
       number: c23
     f_left_ramp_lower:
       number: c24

See :doc:`/config/flashers` for details on how to use flashers.
