Node board on Spike support up to four steppers.
Steppers connect to light outputs on the board and a homing switch (which may
be on another board).
We guess that they are hardware-wise similar to the
:doc:`StepStick </hardware/stepstick/index>` (but that does not matter if you
are using an existing machine).

To configure a stepper in Spike you can use the following example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
     s_stepper_home:
       number: 11-4

   steppers:
     stepper0:
       number: 10-0
       homing_mode: switch
       homing_switch: s_stepper_home
       platform_settings:
         speed: 20
         light_number: 10-10
       named_positions:
         100: test_1
         200: test_2
         500: test_3

This will configure Stepper ``0`` on node ``10``.
You can choose a number from ``0`` to ``3``.
Which ones does not matter but you can only use every number once.

Then you need to look up the motor reference number in your manual.
This is an example from Game of Thrones LE:

.. image:: /hardware/images/spike_stepper_table.png

We are interested in ``10-LP-10``.
This is used as ``light_number`` above.
``10-LP-11`` is not used and we guess that Spike automatically uses the next
output as well.

The home switch is called ``Dragon Home`` in GoT and has the number ``11-SW-4``
according to the manual.
We configure is as ``s_stepper_home`` in this example.

You can change ``speed`` and ``homing_speed`` to configure how fast the
stepper will move.
See :doc:`/mechs/steppers/index` for more details about steppers.
