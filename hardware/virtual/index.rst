Using MPF without physical hardware
===================================

It's possible to run MPF even if you don't have a physical pinball machine
attached to your computer. This is great if you're just starting out, or if
you want to work on your MPF config when you're not around your pinball
machine.

MPF achieves this through "virtual" platform interfaces, of which there are
two options:

Note that if you want to use MPF without a physical pinball machine, you
probably also want to use the :doc:`MPF Monitor </tools/monitor/index>` which is
a graphical tool that lets you interact with lights, switches, and pinball
mechs in MPF which works nicely with the smart virtual platform.
