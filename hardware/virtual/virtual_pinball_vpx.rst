VPX can be used to emulate the hardware of a pinball machine to test your
game without real hardware.
This can be useful for software and hardware development.
To use the VPX platform you need to install the
`MPF-VPX bridge <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-vpcom-bridge>`_ and
add some VPX scripts to your VPX table.

The bridge will connect to the running MPF machine when you start your VPX
table.
As the VPX table is used only to emulate the hardware and should not contain
any game logic.

Installation
------------

Copy the file ``register_vpcom.py`` to your local machine folder.
To register the bridge run a CMD shell as Administrator, then


.. code-block:: console

   python register_vpcom.py --register


(You can use ``--unregister`` to uninstall the bridge)

Use VPX in MPF
--------------

In your ``config.yaml`` configure virtual_pinball as your platform:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   hardware:
      platform: virtual_pinball

or if you already have physical hardware configured start MPF with the ``--vpx`` commandline option (similar to ``-X``):

.. code-block:: console

   mpf both --vpx


Configure VPX
-------------

In VPX you need to adjust your script to talk to MPF.
You can also looks this up in the example project inside the
`bridge repository <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-vpcom-bridge>`_.
The GameName set in VPX is not used to check or validate the MPF machine.

Setup controller and timers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- add ``Set Controller = CreateObject("MPF.Controller")``
- add a Timer ``MPFTimer`` with an interval of 10 to 50ms. Keep this well below the minimal ``default_pulse_ms`` set in MPF for solenoids
- add a ``Sub MPFTimer_Timer`` to update all the lights and solenoids

In Table_Init
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- call Controller.run
- set the Trough switch(es) or create balls for a physical Trough (as in the demo table)
- init NC switches to False

In Drain_Hit (for 1-Ball games)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- set the Trough switch(es)

To use autofire_coils (Slings, Pops etc)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- add a droppable wall to each bumper. This will be used in ``Sub CheckAutofireCoils`` to disable/enable the bumper
- if necessary place an invisible wall behind the slingshots to stop the ball once the slingshots are disabled
- add each autofire object in VPX to ``Sub CheckAutofireCoils``
- use the normal ``Slingshot_Slingshot`` and ``Bumper_Hit`` events

Switch Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- add ``Controller.Switch(MPFSwitchNumber)=SwitchState`` to the ``Switch_Hit/_Unhit`` events. Use "" to include string type numbers
- add ``Controller.PulseSW(MPFSwitchNumber)`` to the ``Switch_Hit`` event of targets, slingshots and bumpers

Controlled Lights (all types)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- create a collection "ControlledLamps"
- assign all controlled VPX lamps (Matrix, GI, LED, Flashers) to the collection "ControlledLamps" and call ``InitLamps``

LEDs and Lamps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- in ``Sub UpdateLamps`` add a case for every MPF light and LED number, setting the state of the VPX lamp/LED. Use "" to include string type numbers

GI strings
^^^^^^^^^^
- create a collection for each GI string, assign the GI lamps to the collections as needed
- assign all GI lamps to the collection "ControlledLamps" and call`` InitLamps``
- in ``Sub UpdateGI`` add a case for every MPF gi string number, setting the state of the VPX GI collection. Use "" to include string type numbers

Flashers
^^^^^^^^

- assign all flasher lamps to the collection "ControlledLamps" and call ``InitLamps``
- in ``Sub UpdateFlashers`` add a case for every MPF flasher number, setting the state of the VPX flasher. Use "" to include string type numbers

Solenoids
^^^^^^^^^

- add all normal solenoids to the ``Sub InitSolenoids``, to initialize them als ``False``
- in ``Sub UpdateSolenoids`` add a case for every MPF coil number, setting the state of the VPX solenoid. Use "" to include string type numbers

Flippers
^^^^^^^^

- add the Flipper routines (``Solenoids`` and ``KeyUp/KeyDown``) as in the demo table. Flippers are handled as autofire coils and can be enabled/disabled using hrdware rules.

To run a game
-------------
1. start VPX as Administrator
2. start MPF, wait until the display has been initialized
3. start VPX table

To exit a game shut down the VPX table first
