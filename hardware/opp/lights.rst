If you're using an OPP incandescent wing card, the lights are
numbered the same as the input switches.  OPP bulbs are numbered
sequentially depending on which wing board controls the output.
Wing position 0 contains bulbs 0 to 7.  Wing position 1 contains
bulbs 8 to 15.  Wing position 2 contains bulbs 16 to 23.  Wing
position 3 contains bulbs 24 to 31. The bulb is numbered using
the position of the OPP card (starting at 0), then a '-', and
finally the bulb number on the card.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    lights:
      some_light:
        number: 1-16
        subtype: matrix

The above example configures a bulb on the second OPP card, and
the third wing board, first bulb  On the microprocessor card, the
input is marked as 2.0 (wing port 2, position 0).
