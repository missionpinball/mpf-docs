Hardware Roadmap
================

There are a few hardware platforms we would like to add in the future because
we think they would be a good fit for custom/homebrew pinball machines:

* Pololu Tic - An USB stepper controller
* Pololu Jrk - An USB motor controller
* Ion Motion RoboClaw - A USB motor controller
* Stern Spike 2 - The bus is similar to Spike 1. Needs testing.
* MyPinballs Custom Pinball Board - Control System for older machines
* Pin2DMD - A color DMD with USB

Let us know in the `MPF User Forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_
if you want to use any of those hardware platforms.
Please also let us know if you know other hardware which we should support.
