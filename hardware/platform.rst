Mixing-and-Matching hardware platforms
======================================

In MPF it's possible to mix-and-match your hardware platforms. For
example, you could use a P-ROC for your coils and switches while using
a FadeCandy for your LEDs. (Or, if you wanted to be crazy, you could
use a FAST controller for your switches and a P-ROC for your coils and
lamps.)

You can specify hardware platforms in three ways:

1. Machine-wide default platform
--------------------------------

Whatever you set in the ``hardware: platform:`` section of your machine-wide
config is the default platform for all types of mechanisms across all of MPF.

For example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   hardware:
      platform: p_roc
      driverboards: pdb

In the above config, the P-ROC platform will be the default for everything.
(switches, coils, lights, LEDs, DMDs, servos, etc.)

2. Device-specific default platform
-----------------------------------

If you want to specify a default for a certain class of devices that is
different than the machine-wide default, you can also do that in the
``hardware:`` section by adding an entry for the type of device you want to
specify the default for.

For example, if you want to use a P-ROC as the default for everything except
for LEDs, which you want to be FadeCandy, you would do it like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   hardware:
      platform: p_roc
      driverboards: pdb
      lights: fadecandy

You can enter a device-specific default for the following types of devices
here:

* coils:
* switches:
* matrix_lights:
* lights:
* dmd:
* rgb_dmd:
* gis:
* flashers:
* servo_controllers:
* accelerometers:
* i2c:

3. Overriding the platform of individual devices
------------------------------------------------

Finally, you can override the platform of an individual device by adding a
``platform:`` setting to that device.

For example, if you're using a FAST Pinball controller which can control up to
256 LEDs, but you also want to add some more LEDs that will be attached to a
FadeCandy, you could set up your config like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    hardware:
        platform: fast

    lights:
        led00:
            number: 0-0
        led01:
            number: 0
            platform: fadecandy

In this example, *led00* will use the FAST platform (and the number 0-0 is a
FAST configuration number), and *led01* will use the FadeCandy platform (and
the number 0 is a Fadecandy number).

You could also invert this, like so:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    hardware:
        platform: fast
        lights: fadecandy

    lights:
        led00:
            number: 0-0
            platform: fast
        led01:
            number: 0

In the example above, *led00* is still a FAST LED and *led01* is still a
FadeCandy LED, but the difference is that while the default platform is FAST,
the default platform for LEDs is FadeCandy. That means you don't have to
specify the platform for LEDs attached to the FadeCandy, but you do need to
specify the platform for LEDs attached to the FAST controller.
