This guide explains how to connect a SmartMatrix RGB LED DMD to a
pinball machine running MPF.

A `SmartMatrix <http://docs.pixelmatix.com/SmartMatrix/shieldref.html>`_ is a
cheap ($20) board that you attach to a Teensy ($25) microcontroller which lets
you connect an RGB DMD matrix display to the computer running MPF. It's a
standalone solution which you can use to add an RGB DMD to a pinball machine
that's using FAST Pinball, P-ROC/P3-ROC, or OPP controller hardware.

MPF supports several different types of RGB DMDs, and the SmartMatrix is just
one of the options. More information about this type of display and other
options that MPF supports is available in the
:doc:`/displays/display/rgb_dmd` documentation.

Here's an image of the SmartMatrix RGB DMD in action:

And a video which explains it all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbZQCByeXOU

The following diagram shows how all the components fit together:

1. Buy all the parts you need
-----------------------------

This solution is very much a "home brew" solution that will require
you to buy a lot of parts from various sources.

Alternatively, FAST pinball also offers a
:doc:`RGB DMD </hardware/fast/dmd>` which contains
controller, panels and mounting brackets (ask them directly since it
is not currently listed on their website). If you go with this solution
skip steps 1 to 3. You still need a power supply (step 4).

(1) The Panels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We originally had to buy the panels directly from China via AliExpress,
but now FAST Pinball sells a kit.
The FAST Pinball option is nice because the price is great and
they also include a mounting bracket that fits a standard DMD cutout
(ask them directly since it is not currently listed on their website).

If you buy the panels yourself on AliExpress, you'll pay about
the same price for just the panels, you won't have a mounting bracket,
and you'll have to deal with customer support from China.
Also FAST tests the panels to make sure all the pixels workâ€”a problem
people were running into when buying from AliExpress.

(2) The Teensy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have your panel, you need a way to talk to them via a
computer. The panels use some kind of 16-pin signalling system which
is some kind of standard in the gigantic advertising display industry.

The solution for MPF is to use a Teensy 3.2 or 3.5 (which is kind of like an Arduino).
The Teensy is available from multiple sources for about $20.
`Here's the link to the website <https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html>`_
of the guy who actually built it, and you can also
`get it from Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/products/2756>`_ which is
nice because you also need the shield (from the next step) which is also
available from them.

The Teensy runs the same software sketches as Arduinos, though it has a
slightly different processor architecture which is needed for the rapid
bit-shifting of data needed to control these panels.

Here's a Teensy:

.. image:: /hardware/images/teensy.jpg

The software to run the Teensy is open source (more on that in Step 3)
and the Teensy has a USB port which you connect to your computer which
MPF uses to send the display data to the panels.

(3) The SmartMatrix Shield
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next you need a way for the Teensy to connect to the displays. That
can be done with the SmartMatrix shield
(`V4 of the shield is $20 at Adafruit <http://www.adafruit.com/products/1902>`_).

The SmartMatrix shield is a "dumb" device
that basically just connects the Teensy's GPIO pins to the 16-pin
ribbon cable that drives the displays.

.. image:: /hardware/images/smartmatrix_shield.jpg

The Teensy mounts onto the
SmartMatrix shield, creating a single unit which accepts data via USB
on one end and spits out the 16-pin signal for the display panels on
the other.

.. image:: /hardware/images/smartmatrix_shield_with_teensy.jpg

(4) The Power Supply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These RGB LED displays require 5vdc for power. At first you might
think, "Cool! I have 5v elsewhere in my machine, so I'll just tap into
that!" Not so fast. These displays require *a lot* of power. After
all, each pixel is actually three separate LEDs (one each for red,
green, and blue), and a 128x32 display means that you have 4,096
pixels. So that's 12,228 LEDs you need to power!

If you're ordering your RGB LED display panels from FAST Pinball,
you can also order a
`5v, 10A power supply from them for $19 <https://squareup.com/store/fast-pinball-llc/item/five-volt-ten-amp-switching-power-supply>`_.

.. image:: /hardware/images/5v10a_psu.jpg

An ATX computer power supply will probably have a decent amount of amps also,
so that could be an option too, just check the specs.
Any other 5V supply with decent power should also work.

One thing about these RGB LED-based displays is they are bright.
Like, really, really bright. (We're talking "burn your retinas if you
stare straight at them" kind of bright.)

So even though you can do the math and read that if every pixel
is on, full white, 100%, that might take more power than you have,
there is no way you're going to run these things at full brightness.

Even at 50% brightness, (which would draw only 50% power) most people
find these panels to be too bright. One user runs his at 25%, another
at 18%. So it's possible that you might be fine with 5-7 amps of power.

You'll need to connect the power supply up to both panels (the 128x32
display is made up of two 64x32 panels), and while you're at it you can
also use it to power your Teensy.

There's a trace you have to cut on the Teensy to control whether it's
powered externally or by USB. Don't hook it up to external power if
you haven't cut that trace!

2. Load the SmartMatrix code onto the Teensy
--------------------------------------------

Once your hardware's built, you need to load the code onto the Teensy
which receives the display data via USB and converts and sends it to the pins
connected to the SmartMatrix controller. The people who make the
SmartMatrix controller have code sample code available. We just took
their sample code, removed all the clutter we don't need, and made it
available in the tools folder in the MPF download package. (Here's a
`direct link to the code <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missionpinball/mpf/dev/tools/smart_matrix_dmd_teensy_code/smart_matrix_dmd_teensy_code.ino>`_
which you can use since you probably installed MPF via pip and don't
have the download package available.

Also, `here's the original sample code <https://github.com/pixelmatix/SmartMatrix/blob/sm3.0/examples/FeatureDemo/FeatureDemo.ino>`_
we based our code on.

If you are using V4 of the shield, you need to insert this line of code in the first line:

::

   #include <SmartLEDShieldV4.h> // this line must be first

The V4 shield's library uses more RAM which can causes the Teensy 3.2 to crash during animations or video playback. Using a Teensy 3.5 or 3.6 solves this issue as they have more RAM.

Note that the width and height of your display is set in lines 11 & 12. You can change
that if you want to use a different size display.

Mark Sunnucks was able to run a 128x64 display by setting the height there and also by changing the
DMAs from 4 to 2 in line 14.

Also note that you can set the brightness of the display in this code too. You can control
the brightness in MPF as well, but if you know for sure (maybe due to
power limitations) that you never want the brightness to go over a certain
amount, then you can set it here and it will be "hard coded" into your Teensy.
(You can change this and re-flash your Teensy at any time.)

Here's a quick overview of how to install this code onto the Teensy. Full instructions are
`here <https://github.com/pixelmatix/SmartMatrix>`_.

+ Install the Arduino IDE v1.8.5
+ Install the Teensyduino add-in which adds support for the Teensy
+ Load the smart_matrix_dmd_teensy_code.ino sketch from the mpf/tools
  folder or `this link <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missionpinball/mpf/dev/tools/smart_matrix_dmd_teensy_code/smart_matrix_dmd_teensy_code.ino>`_
+ Push the button on the Teensy to put it into programming mode
+ Compile & load the code onto the Teensy from the Arduino IDE

3. Configure your SmartMatrix hardware settings
-----------------------------------------------

Once you have your hardware all set, you need to add a ``smartmatrix:`` section
to your machine-wide config and which tells MPF how to talk to RGB DMDs that
use the SmartMatrix platform.

The main thing you have to figure out is the port that the Teensy uses. On
Windows, you can just open Device Manager and see which port appears when you
plug in the Teensy.

On Mac or Linux, open up the terminal window and type the following command:
``ls /dev/tty.*``  The output of this command will look something like this
on Mac:

::

   /dev/tty.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port
   /dev/tty.usbmodem1448891

Or this on linux:

::

   /dev/ttyUSB0
   /dev/ttyACM0

The port will be the one that has "usbmodem" in the name on Mac. On Linux it
will probably be ttyUSBx or ttyACMx. (The actual number will likely be
different on your system.) You can run this command with the
Teensy unplugged, then plug it in, then run the command again, and see which
port appears.

So on Windows, you'll end up with something like:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    hardware:
        rgb_dmd: smartmatrix

    smartmatrix:
        smartmatrix_1:
           port: com12
           baud: 2500000
           old_cookie: false

And on Mac or Linux, it will look something like:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    hardware:
        rgb_dmd: smartmatrix
    
    smartmatrix:
        smartmatrix_1:
           port: "/dev/tty.usbmodem1448891"
           baud: 2500000
           old_cookie: false


Just enter the ``baud:`` and ``old_cookie:`` settings like they are in the
example above. These are the settings that are needed for the SmartMatrix.
If you are using the FAST DMD board set baud to
`3000000`.

3. Add a physical RGB DMD device entry
--------------------------------------

Once you have your SmartMatrix hardware platform set, you need to create the
actual device entry for the RGB DMD and map it back to the SmartMatrix
platform.

You do this in the ``rgb_dmds:`` section of the machine config. This
section is like the other common sections (switches, coils, etc.) where you
enter the name(s) of your device(s), and then under each one, you enter its
settings.

(And yes, in case you're wondering, it's possible to have more than one
physical DMD.)

To do this, create a section in your machine-wide config called
``rgb_dmds:``, and then pick a name for the DMD, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    rgb_dmds:
      smartmatrix_1:
         platform: smartmatrix
         hardware_brightness: .17
         source_display: dmd

There are several settings you can enter here. (See the :doc:`/config/rgb_dmds`
for details.) The only one you need to have is ``platform: smartmatrix`` which
tells MPF that this RGB DMD should use the SmartMatrix hardware interface you
configured in the previous step. (Otherwise if you don't specify a platform, it
will use the default platform which probably doesn't support RGB DMDs. See the
:doc:`/hardware/platform` guide for details.)

You'll probably also want to configure the brightness, which is a multiplier
from 0.0 to 1.0 that's applied to every pixel that's sent to the DMD.
In other words, the example of ``brightness: .17`` means that each pixel will
be shown at 17% brightness. (These things are crazy bright!)

.. note::

   If you set the brightness multiplier in the sketch code .INO file you loaded
   onto the Teensy, then that will multiply the brightness after MPF sends
   it. In other words, if you set .5 in the config file and .5 in the sketch,
   then the final brightness will be 25%. You might want to set the absolute
   max brightness in the .INO file once and then fine-tune it via the config
   file later.

4. Set a source display
-----------------------

Now that you have everything configured, the last step is to make sure the DMD
knows what content to show. In MPF, you do this by mapping a physical DMD to
an :doc:`MPF display </displays/display/index>`.

By default, the DMD will look for a display (in your :doc:`/config/displays`
section called "dmd". However you can override this and configure the DMD to
use whatever logical display you want by setting a ``source_display:``
setting. (Just make sure that the width and height of your source display match
the physical pixel dimensions of the DMD or else it will be weird.)

A final config you can test
---------------------------

At this point you're all set, and whatever slides and widgets are shown on the
DMD's source display in MPF-MC should be shown on the physical RGB DMD.

That said, all these options can be kind of confusing, so we created a quick
example config you can use to make sure you have yours set right. (You can
actually just save this config to ``config.yaml`` in a blank machine folder
and run it to see it in action which will verify that you've got everything
working properly.)

.. note::

   Be sure to change the ``smartmatrix:port:`` setting in this example config
   to match whatever port your Teensy is connected to.

To run this sample config, you can either run ``mpf both``.

When you run it, do not use the ``-x`` or ``-X`` options, because either of
those will tell MPF to not use physical hardware which means it won't try to
connect to the Teensy.

Note that the :doc:`/displays/display/rgb_dmd` guide has more details
on the window and slide settings used in this machine config.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

      window:  # on screen window

        height: 200
