How to configure MPF for FAST Pinball hardware
==============================================

Here's a list of all the How To guides which explain how to use MPF with FAST
Pinball hardware. These guides include the numbering format (how you map
specific entries in your config files to board and connector locations) as well
as overall settings that affect how your FAST hardware performs. (Watch dogs,
update speeds, etc.)

This page is about the software side of things.
Hardware and electrical engineering stuff is documented at the
`FAST section in the pinballmakers.com Wiki <http://pinballmakers.com/wiki/index.php/Fast>`_.
