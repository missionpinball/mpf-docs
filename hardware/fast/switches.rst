To configure switches with FAST Pinball hardware, you can follow the guides
and instructions in the :doc:`/mechs/switches/index` docs.

However there are a few things to know and some additional options you get
with FAST hardware that is discussed here.

number:
-------

When you're using FAST IO boards, switches plug into individual IO boards.
Then the IO boards are connected together in a loop.

.. image:: /hardware/images/fast-io-3208.png

The ``number:`` setting for each switch is its board's position number in the
chain, then the dash, then the switch input number. Note that the position
number starts with zero, so the first IO board in the chain is 0, the second
is 1, etc.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      my_switch:
         number: 0-0  # first board, switch 0
      some_other_switch:
         number: 2-24  # third board, switch 24

Notes:

   * The first board in the chain is board 0.
   * The boards are counted in the direction of the "out" connector on the
     controller board.
   * Different models of IO boards have different numbers of switches, and
     MPF will make sure that the numbers work for each type of board. (e.g.
     a switch number 10 isn't valid on an 0804 board since that board only has
     8 switches numbered 0-7).

Also note that prior versions of MPF just numbered all the switches in one
continuous sequence from the first board through the last, but that was
confusing. You can still do that if you want (in integer format),
but we feel the board-input format is much easier to understand.

Debounce options
----------------

FAST controllers have advanced capabilities when it comes to
debouncing switches. (More on what that is :doc:`here </mechs/switches/debounce>`).

Since FAST switches are directly connected (e.g. there is no switch matrix),
and since every FAST IO board has its own processor and firmware, the states
of switches are checked often (every 1ms). You can specify the exact debounce
time that a switch must consistently be in a new state in both the open and
close directions.

Specifying default debounce settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, MPF provides two debounce profiles for switches ("normal" and
"quick"). When using FAST pinball controllers, the "normal" debounce profile
is ``4ms`` for both the debounce open and debounce closed times, and the
"quick" debounce profile is ``2ms`` for both debounce open and closed times.

You can change any of these in the ``fast:`` section of your machine-wide
config, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   fast:
      default_quick_debounce_open: 2ms
      default_quick_debounce_close: 2ms
      default_normal_debounce_open: 4ms
      default_normal_debounce_close: 4ms

(Note that other settings from the ``fast:`` section of your config have not
been included here for clarity.)

Per-switch debounce settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using FAST Pinball controllers, you can also specify the debounce open and
debounce closed settings on a per-switch basis. To do that, just add a
``debounce_open:`` and/or ``debounce_close:`` setting to an individual switch,
like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      my_switch:
         number: 1-0
         platform_settings:
            debounce_open: 5ms
            debounce_close: 20ms
      some_other_switch:
         number: 3-24

Valid values are 1 to 255 ms.
