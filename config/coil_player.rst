.. note:: This section can also be used in a show file in the ``coils:`` section of a step.

.. overview

The ``coil_player:`` section of your config is where you configure coil/solenoid/driver actions (pulse, enable,
disable, etc.) based on events. It's also used in shows (via the ``coils:`` section) to perform
coil actions in that show step.

Example from a config file:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   coil_player:
      some_event: coil_1
      some_other_event:
         coil_2:
            action: enable
            hold_power: .5

In the example above, when the event called ``some_event`` is posted, coil_1 will pulse.
When the event ``some_other_event`` is posted, coil_2 will enable (be held on) at power
level 4.

Note that the ``some_event: coil_1`` is entered in a different way than the ``some_other_event:``.
The first one has a simple key/value pair, whereas the second has a complete nested sub-configuration.

The first example shows the "express" config, while the second shows the
full config. (What's an "express config?" Details :doc:`here </config/instructions/express_config>`.

The coil player's express config is the "pulse" action.

Example coil player from a show:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: test
   - time: 0
     coils:
       coil1: pulse

See :doc:`/config_players/coil_player` for details.

Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``coil_player:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

action:
~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string`` (case-insensitive). Options include ``pulse``, ``enable``, ``on``, ``disable``, or ``off``. Default: ``pulse``

What action the coil should perform. Note that "on" and "enable" are the same, and that "disable" and "off" are the same.

hold_power:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: float(0,1). Default: ``None``

This setting lets you control how much power is sent to the coil when
it's "held" in the on position. This is an float value from 0-1 (i.e.
0% power to 100% power) which controls the relative power.
If not set it will use ``default_hold_power`` of the :doc:`/config/coils`.

pulse_power:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: float(0,1). Default: ``None``

The power factor which controls how much power is applied during the initial
pulse phase of the coil's activation. (Note that not all hardware platforms
support variable pulse power.)

If not set it will use ``default_pulse_power`` of the :doc:`/config/coils`.

pulse_ms:
~~~~~~~~~
The number of milliseconds you'd like this coil to pulse for. This setting
overrides the coil's *default_pulse_ms* setting. Note that this setting
only affects pulse actions. Make sure you are not exceeding the coil's
*max_pulse_ms* setting.
If not set it will use ``default_pulse_ms`` of the :doc:`/config/coils`.
