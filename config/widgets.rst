.. overview

The ``widgets:`` section of your config is where you pre-define "named" widgets
that you can then use later in shows and the widget_player section of a config
file. See the :doc:`/displays/widgets/index` guide for details.
You can test slides and widgets interactively using
:doc:`Interactive MC (iMC) </tools/imc/index>`.

Since there are many different types of widgets in MPF, it doesn't make sense to list
all the widget type and all the options here. Instead check out the :doc:`/displays/widgets/index`
documentation which has all the details, including config file reference for different
types of widgets.
