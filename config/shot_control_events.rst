The integer that is provided for the state the shot should move to when the event is posted.
States are indexed at ``0``, which means the first state is ``0``, second state is ``1``, etc.

If set to true, the state of shot will be modified even if the shot is disabled. If set to false,
this will be ignored unless the shot is currently enabled when the event is posted.
