.. overview

The *auditor:* section of the machine configuration file lets you
control what events the MPF's auditor module includes in its audits.

Here's an example which is the settings we including in the default
*mpfconfig.yaml* file. (So these are the settings that are included by
default with every game you run.) Also, by default, the auditor saves its audits to ``/audits/audits.yaml``
in the folder for each machine. (Check out the documentation on the Auditor to see a sample audit log file.)

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    auditor:
        save_events:
            ball_ended
            game_ended
        audit:
            shots
            switches
            events
            player
        events:
            ball_search_begin
            machine_init_phase_1
            game_started
            game_ended
            machine_reset
        player:
            score
        num_player_top_records: 10

Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``auditor:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

audit:
~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

This is a list of the various types of things you want to include in
your audit file. There are currently four options:

+ shots - tracks the number of times each shot has been made
+ switches - tracks the number of times each switch has been hit.
+ events - whether the auditor should audit certain events. (Add the
  events you want to track to the *events* section.)
+ player - includes player variables (score, maybe shots or goals
  they've achieved, etc.) See the *player* section below for details.

events:
~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

A list of which events you want to audit. These are the names of any
events you want.

num_player_top_records:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``. Default: ``1``

For player-specific variables, you have the option of track the "top"
number of each. So in the example above, since the only player item is
*score*, the auditor will track the top 10 highest scores, plus the
total count and the overall average.

player:
~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

A list of player variables you want to audit. The auditor will
save a certain number (configurable via the
``num_player_top_records:`` setting), as well as the total number of
entries and the current average.

save_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``ball_ended``

Events in this list, when posted, trigger the auditor to save its audits to disk.
