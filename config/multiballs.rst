.. overview

The ``multiballs:`` section of your config is where you can
configure multiball devices. Multiball devices are "abstract"
devices in that they're more of a concept rather than a physical
device on the playfield. The multiball "device" is used to start
multiball. This section can be used in your machine-wide config files.
This section can be used in mode-specific config files.

Here's an example which contains several different multiball configs. (In the
real world, you'd probably only have one multiball for each mode.)

Required settings
-----------------

The following sections are required in the ``multiballs:`` section of your config:

ball_count:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: template_int.

The number of balls this multiball should eject (and maintain during shoot again period).
This is a template so you can use :doc:`dynamic values </config/instructions/dynamic_values>`
to calculate this during runtime.


Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``multiballs:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

add_a_ball_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

Events in this list, when posted, will add one ball into play. Posting an event
multiple times will add one ball for each time the event is posted.

This is useful for "add-a-ball" functionality (which you can combine with a
counter and/or conditional events if you want to cap how many total balls can
be added into play).

ball_count_type:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: add, total. Default: ``total``

Set this to either ``total`` or ``add``. Default is ``total``.

This setting controls the behavior of how the multiball calculates the number of
balls it should add into play. Adjusting this setting is useful when you have
multiple (or stacked) multiballs and you want to control how the combined counts
work.

*total*
   Means the ``ball_count:`` setting will provide a target for the total number of
   balls that should be in play when this multiball starts. So if this multiball
   has a ``ball_count: 3``, and it starts when 2 balls are live on the playfield,
   then this multiball will only add 1 more ball to bring the total to 3.

*add*
   Means that the ``ball_count:`` setting will specify the number of balls that are
   added into play on top of whatever number of balls are already in play. So if this
   multiball is set to ``ball_count: 2`` and there are already 2 balls in play, then
   this multiball will add 2 more balls for a total of 4 balls live.

ball_locks:
~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: string name of a :doc:`ball_devices <ball_devices>` device.

Use those devices first when ejecting balls to the playfield on multiball start. On start all balls from all
locks will be ejected (maybe more than ball_count). If there are not enough balls in the lock more balls will be
requested to the source_playfield.

disable_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

Events in this list, when posted, disable this multiball. When disabled,
the other events (like start and add a ball) do not work. If this multiball
is in a mode config, then it will also be disabled when the mode it's in stops.

enable_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

Events in this list, when posted, enable this multiball. Note that enabling a
multiball is not the same as starting it, but the other events (like to start
the multiball or, or add a ball, etc.) do not work unless this multiball is enabled.

Note that if you do not add any ``enable_events:`` (which is the default), this
multiball will be automatically enabled when the mode it's in starts.

replace_balls_in_play:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``false``

This setting controls whether the multiball should include existing balls in play
when counting the number of balls to add to the playfield. Specifically for
machines which physically lock multiple balls, this setting should be used in
tandem with balls-to-replace from :doc:`/config/multiball_locks` to accurately populate
the multiball when it starts.

See :doc:`/game_logic/multiballs/multiball_with_traditional_ball_lock` for detailed
instructions on using this setting.

reset_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`). Default: machine_reset_phase_3, ball_starting

Event(s) that reset this multiball, which means they disable it as well as
disabling shoot again and resetting the ball add counts to 0.

shoot_again:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``time string (ms)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`) . Default: ``10s``

Specifies a time period for "shoot again" which is a sort of automatic ball save for
multiballs. The timer will start when this multiball starts, and any balls that
drain during this time will be re-added into play.

source_playfield:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a :doc:`ball_devices <ball_devices>` device. Default: ``playfield``

The name of the playfield (from the ``playfields:`` section of your machine config
that this multiball will add balls to. You don't have to worry about this unless
you have multiple playfields that you're managing separately (which is rare, usually
only in head-to-head type games).

start_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

Events in this list, when posted, start the multiball. Note that these events will
only have an effect if this multiball is enabled.

start_or_add_a_ball_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

Events in this list, when posted, will either start the multiball, or, if it's
started, will add another ball.

stop_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

Events in this list, when posted, stop the multiball. If there are multiball balls
on the playfield, there's nothing that can be done about that (unless you want to
disable the flippers). However stopping the multiball will cut off the "shoot again"
period.

console_log:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full. Default: ``basic``

Log level for the console log for this device.

debug:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

See the :doc:`documentation on the debug setting </config/instructions/debug>`
for details.

file_log:
~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full. Default: ``basic``

Log level for the file log for this device.

label:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``%``

Name of this device in service mode.

tags:
~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``.

Unused.
