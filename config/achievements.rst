achievements:
=============

*Config file section*

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Valid in :doc:`machine config files </config/instructions/machine_config>` | **NO**  |

The ``achievements:`` section of your config is where you configure
:doc:`player-based "achievement" tracking </game_logic/achievements/index>`.

Like most things in MPF configs, the highest-level entries in the
``achievements:`` section of your config are the names of the individual
achievements, and then indented under each of those are the settings for that
individual achievement.

Here's an example achievements section from Brooks & Dunn:

General Settings
----------------

The following settings are used to configure each achievement. Since
achievements are so flexible, these are all optional, though you need to use
some of them or your achievement won't do anything. :)

show_tokens:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, each in the format of type: ``str``:``str``. Default: ``None``

This is an indented list of key/value pairs for the
:doc:`show tokens </shows/tokens>` that will be sent to the shows that are
played when this achievement changes state. (See the settings called
"show_when_XXX" further down in this documentation.)

restart_after_stop_possible:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``True``

Is it possible to restart this achievement after it's been stopped?

restart_on_next_ball_when_started:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``True``

If True/Yes, then this achievement will stay in the "started" state when the
player's next ball starts if it was in the "started" state when the previous
ball ended. This is useful if you want to restart a mode that was running when
the ball ended.

Note that this restart will also play the ``show_when_started:`` show, and it
will also post the ``events_when_started:`` events. 

If False/No, this achievement's state will change from "started" to "stopped"
when the next ball starts. This will *not* play the ``show_when_stopped:`` show and
it will *not* post the ``events_when_stopped:`` events.


enable_on_next_ball_when_enabled:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``True``

If True/Yes, this achievement will stay "enabled" when the next ball starts if
it was enabled when the last ball ended. If False/No, this achivement will be
changed to "disabled" when the next ball starts.

This is similar to the ``restart_on_next_ball_when_started:`` event from above,
except it applies to the "enabled" state instead of the "started" state.

This setting will also play the ``show_when_enabled:`` show and post the 
``events_when_enabled:`` events when re-enabling, but will not play or post
anything when disabling.

debug:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Enables debug logging.

Control Events
--------------

The following settings specify which MPF events cause this achievement to move
to a new state.

enable_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``None``

Events in this list, when posted, cause this achievement to switch to its
"enabled" state. These events will also cause the achievement to play the
show defined in the ``show_when_enabled:`` setting and to emit (post) events
in the ``events_when_enabled:`` setting.

select_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``None``

Events in this list, when posted, cause this achievement to switch to its
"selected" state. These events will also cause the achievement to play the
show defined in the ``show_when_selected:`` setting and to emit (post) events
in the ``events_when_selected:`` setting.

Note that the "selected" state, in MPF, is used to describe an achievement
that is currently selected ("highlighted" or "lit") and available to be
started. This would typically be tied to a show (via the
``show_when_selected:`` setting) that causes a light or LED to flash.

start_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``None``

Events in this list, when posted, cause this achievement to switch to its
"started" state. These events will also cause the achievement to play the
show defined in the ``show_when_started:`` setting and to emit (post) events
in the ``events_when_started:`` setting.

complete_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``None``

Events in this list, when posted, cause this achievement to switch to its
"completed" state. These events will also cause the achievement to play the
show defined in the ``show_when_completed:`` setting and to emit (post) events
in the ``events_when_completed:`` setting.

disable_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``None``

Events in this list, when posted, cause this achievement to switch to its
"disabled" state. These events will also cause the achievement to play the
show defined in the ``show_when_disabled:`` setting and to emit (post) events
in the ``events_when_disabled:`` setting.

stop_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``None``

Events in this list, when posted, cause this achievement to switch to its
"stopped" state. These events will also cause the achievement to play the
show defined in the ``show_when_stopped:`` setting and to emit (post) events
in the ``events_when_stopped:`` setting.

reset_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, either as a list of events, or key/value pairs of
event names and delay times. (See the
:doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` documentation for details
on how to enter settings here.

Default: ``None``

Events in this list, when posted, cause this achievement to reset back to its
default state (which will either be "disabled" or, if you have
``start_enabled: true``, "enabled")
