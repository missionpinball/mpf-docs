.. overview

The ``psus:`` section of your config is where you power supply units.
See :doc:`/hardware/voltages_and_power/index` for details about voltages in
pinball machines and some electric details.
Then specify to which PSU your :doc:`coils <coils>` are connected.
This is used for power management. In some cases, MPF ,ay deliberately delay
coil pulses to prevent too many coils from firing and drawing to much current
from your PSU.
:doc:`Ball devices <ball_devices>` and :doc:`drop target <drop_targets>` do
this by default to ensure more consistent pulses.
