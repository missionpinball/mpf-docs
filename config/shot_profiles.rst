The ``shot_profiles:`` section of your config is where you
configure the settings for various *shot profiles* that you can then
apply to your shots.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! config: mode1
   shot_profiles:
       my_default_profile:
           states:
             - name: unlit
               show: "off"
             - name: lit
               show: "on"

<name>:
-------

This is the name of the shot profile, which is how you'll refer to it
elsewhere in your config files when you apply it to shots. The sample
shot_profiles: section of the config file above contains a profile named
"default" (which is actually included in the system-wide ``mpfconfig.yaml`` file).

advance_on_hit:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``True``

This setting controls whether the active shot profile advances to its
next state when the shot is hit. The default is true, but you can set
this to false if you want to manually advance the shot some other way.
(If this is false, you can still advance the shot with
*advance_events*, for example.)

block:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``false``

Lets you control whether hits to this shot
are propagated down to lower priority modes. The default value is true
if you don't specify this, meaning that blocking is enabled

If you have ``block: true`` in a shot profile, then hits to that shot when that
profile is applied only are registered in the highest mode where that
shot is enabled. If you set ``block: false``, then when a shot is hit in
one mode it will also look down to lower priority modes where that
shot is enabled. If that lower priority mode has a different profile
applied then it will also register a hit event based on that profile.
This will continue until it reaches a level with ``block: true`` or
until it reaches the end of the mode list.

This is better explained with an example.

Imagine you have four lanes at the top of your
machine which you use in your base mode in a normal lane-change
fashion. (Lanes are unlit by default, hit a lane and they light,
complete all four lanes for an award.) Now imagine you also use those
lanes for a skillshot where one of the lanes is flashing and you try
to hit it while the skillshot is enabled. In this case, you'd have
different shot profiles for each mode, perhaps the default profile in
your base mode (with unlit->lit states) and a skillshot profile in
your skill shot mode (with flashing->complete states).

By default, if
the player hits the a lane when the skill shot mode is running, the
skillshot profile is the active profile so it's the shot that gets the
hit. But then when the skill shot mode ends, the lane the player just
hit is not lit, since that shot profile was not active when it was
hit. (In other words, the skillshot blocked the hit event.) So if you
add ``block: false`` to your skillshot shot profile, then when the shot
is hit when the skill shot mode is running, it will receive the hit
and advance the shot from flashing to complete. Then the lower base
mode will also get the shot, and it will advance its state from unlit
to lit. The lights for the shot will only reflect the skillshot lights
since it's the higher priority, however, you will get
*yourshot_skillshot_flashing_hit* and *yourshot_default_unlit_hit*
events since both the hits registered because you set the skillshot
profile not to block the hit.

loop:
~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Controls whether the states of this profile "loop" when they reach the
end. If true, then the shot being hit when the profile is in the last
state causes the profile to "loop" around back to the first state.
This is useful if you want to create a "toggle" shot where you could
create a profile with two steps (lit and unlit) and then set loop to
be true. (If you have more than two steps in the shot profile, then
the looping will go from the last one back to the first one.) The
default is false, meaning when the profile reaches its last state, it
will just stay there even if it's hit again.

player_variable:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

This is a profile setting that lets you specify the name of the player
variable that will be used to track the status of this shot when this
profile is applied. If you don't specify the name of a player
variable, it will automatically use *<shot_name>_<profile_name>* as
the player variable.

rotation_pattern:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``R``

This setting lets you specify a custom rotation pattern that's used
when an event from this profile's rotation_events: section is posted.
You enter it as a list of Ls and Rs, for example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! config: mode1
   shot_profiles:
       my_default_profile:
           states:
             - name: unlit
               show: "off"
             - name: red
               show: led_color
               show_tokens:
                  color: red
             - name: blue
               show: "flash"
               show_tokens:
                  color: blue

           rotation_pattern: L, L, L, L, R, R, R, R

In the above example, the first four times a rotation_event is posted,
this shot group will rotate to the left, then the next four to the
right, then the next four to the left, etc. The pattern will loop.
This is how you could specify a single lit target that "sweeps" back
and forth across a group of five targets, for example. This only
impacts *rotation_events*, not *rotate_left_events* and
*rotate_right_events* since those events imply a direction.

show:
~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

The name of the show associated with this shot profile. Note that you can
specify a single show which applies to the entire shot profile (here), or you
can specify a different show for each step/state (in the ``states:`` section,
covered below.

If you specify a show here, then the show will not auto play, and instead will
advance to the next step with each step/state advancement of the shot. This is
useful for simple things like turning a light on or off. For more complex
scenarios, you can set a full show per step/state below.

show_when_disabled:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Controls whether the lights or LEDs for shots which have this profile
applied will be active when this shot is disabled. By default this is
*true*, so if the shot profile associated with this shot has the light
turning on, then when you disable the shot the light will stay on. Set
it to *false* if you want the lights or LEDs to turn off when the shot
is disabled. (Note that even when this is false, the lights or LEDs
can still be controlled by other light scripts, light shows, manual
commands, etc.)

state_names_to_not_rotate:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

This works like *state_names_to_rotate*, except it's the opposite
where you can enter the names of states to not rotate. You don't need
to use bothâ€”the options are here just for convenience.

state_names_to_rotate:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

This is a list of state names that will be used to determine which
shots in a shot group will be rotated. By default, all states are
included. But this can be nice if you only want to rotate a subset of
the states. For example, if you have a shot group with a bunch of
lights that represent modes, you might have a shot profile with states
called *unlit*, *active* (flashing), and *complete* (lit). You'd use
these shots (and their lights) to track the game modes you've
completed, so at any time, you'd have a bunch of unlit shots
representing modes you haven't completed yet, solidly lit shots for
modes you've completed, and a single flashing shot representing the
mode that will be started next. Then in your game if you wanted to
rotate among the incomplete targets, you would set your shot profile
so it only rotated those state names, like this

states:
-------

The ``states:`` section contains the following nested sub-settings

Under each shot profile name, a setting called *states:* lets you
specify various properties for the target in different states. You can
configure multiple states in the order that you want them to be
stepped through. (You use a dash, then a space, then a setting to
indicate that items should be a list. The following sections explain
the settings for each state:

name:
~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``.

This is the name of the step. In other words, it's what "state" the
shot is in when this profile step is active.

loops:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``. Default: ``-1``

Loops setting from the show player, controls how many times the show loops (``-1`` is unlimited).

manual_advance:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

If True, the show does not automatically advance to the next step.

priority:
~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``. Default: ``0``

The priority shift of the show that's played.

show:
~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

The name of the show that will be played when a shot with this profile applied is in
this step (or state).

show_tokens:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, each in the format of type: ``str``:``str``. Default: ``None``

Show tokens for the show.

speed:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``number`` (will be converted to floating point). Default: ``1``

Playback speed of the show.

start_step:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``. Default: ``1``

The step number the show will start on.

sync_ms:
~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``. Default: ``None``

The sync_ms value of the show.
