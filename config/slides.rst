*Config file section*

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Valid in :doc:`machine config files </config/instructions/machine_config>` | **YES** |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+
| Valid in :doc:`mode config files </config/instructions/mode_config>`       | **YES** |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------+

The ``slides:`` section of your config is where you pre-define "named" slides
that you can then use later in shows and the slide_player section of a config
file. See the :doc:`/displays/slides/showing_slides` guide for details on
this.
You can test slides and widgets interactively using
:doc:`Interactive MC (iMC) </tools/imc/index>`.

Slide names are universal throughout MPF, so if you create two slides with the
same name—even in different modes—one of them will overwrite the other and
things will be confusing, so don't do that.

See the :doc:`/displays/slides/creating_slides` documentation for full details
on how to create slides. (You should definitely "learn" about slides there.
The settings here are mostly used for reference later.)

There are several different ways you can enter slides. In all cases, you'll
have a ``slides:`` section of your config, and then under that, you'll have
sub-entries which are slide names. But what is entered under each slide name
varies.

.. rubric:: Option 1: Slide with a widget

If you want to define a slide that only has a single widget, you can just
add the :doc:`widget's properties </displays/widgets/types>` under the slide
name. In the example below, we're defining two slides, one called
*my_slide_1* and the other called *my_slide_2*, and they each only have a
single widget.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
       my_slide_1:
           type: text
           text: THIS IS MY SLIDE
       my_slide_2:
           type: text
           text: THIS IS ANOTHER SLIDE
           color: lime
           font_size: 25

.. rubric:: Option 2: List of widgets

Of course many slides you'll define will have more than one widget. To add
multiple widgets to a slide, just enter them like you entered a single
widget, but use a dash (and a space) to dictate where a new widget starts,
like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
       my_slide_1:
           - type: text
             text: THIS IS MY SLIDE
           - type: image
             image: johnny_5
       my_slide_2:
           - type: text
             text: THIS IS ANOTHER SLIDE
           - type: text
             y: 20%
             text: IT HAS MORE THAN 1 WIDGET
           - type: ellipse
             color: red
             width: 200
             height: 100


.. rubric:: Option 3: Widgets under "widgets:" section

In addition to widgets, slides have other options (as described below), and
sometimes you might want to define a slide that has widgets and slide
settings. To do that, you need to move your widgets definition into a
sub-section called "widgets:", and then you can add the other slide settings
under the slide along with the widgets.

Here's an example. Note that the slide with multiple widgets is using the
dash in the widgets: section to separate the individual widgets.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
       my_slide_1:
           background_color: red
           widgets:
             type: text
             text: THIS IS MY SLIDE
       my_slide_2:
           widgets:
            - type: text
              text: THIS IS ANOTHER SLIDE
            - type: text
              y: 20%
              text: IT HAS MORE THAN 1 WIDGET
            - type: ellipse
              color: red
              width: 200
              height: 100
           expire: 2s
           transition:
              type: move_in
              direction: right

You can mix-and-match the three options for entering widgets as needed within
the same slides: section of your config.

Creating a blank slide
----------------------

If you want to create a blank slide (perhaps an empty canvas that you'll
populate via the widget player later?), then you need to tell the slides:
section that you have an empty list. In YAML, that's done with a [ and ]
next to each other (which is confusing because it looks like a rectangle, but
it's not, like this: ``[]``.

You can use this format to create a blank slide with no options:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
      my_blank_slide: []

Or you can use it to create a blank slide with options, but no widgets, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
      my_blank_slide:
         background_color: red
         widgets: []

Settings
--------

The following sections provide additional options for your slide which you
can use if you move the widgets into their own ``widgets:`` section. If you
just include the widgets as top-level entries (like Options 1 and 2 above),
then the default values for each of these settings below will be used.

background_color:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``color`` (*color name*, *hex*, or list of values *0*-*255*). Default: ``000000ff``

The background color of the slide. Details on how to enter color values are :doc:`here </config/instructions/colors>`.

debug:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Set to true/yes if you want to add addition debug information about this slide to the log. (Note this requires a verbose log to see.)

expire:
~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings) </config/instructions/time_strings>` . Default: ``None``

Sets an expiration time which will automatically remove this slide. If it's showing when it's removed, the next-highest priority
active slide will be shown in its place.

Note that you can also configure expiration when the slide is shown (in either
a show or via the slide_player), so you don't need to define an expire setting as
part of the slide definition unless you want that expire time to be used every time the
slide is shown.

If you specify an expire time in both places, the expire time in the slide_player
or show will take precedence.

opacity:
~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``number`` (will be converted to floating point). Default: ``1.0``

Sets the overall opacity of the slide. A value of 1.0 is fully opaque. A value
of .5 means the slide is 50% transparent, and a value of 0 means the slide will
be invisible and you'll probably be confused about why it's not showing up.

transition:
~~~~~~~~~~~

A sub-configuration of key/value pairs that make up the incoming transition
that will be used when this slide is shown. See the :doc:`/displays/slides/transitions`
documentation for details.

Note that you can also configure a transition when the slide is shown (in either
a show or via the slide_player), so you don't need to define a transition as
part of the slide definition unless you want that transition to be used every time the
slide is shown.

If you specify a transition in both places, the transition in the slide_player
or show will take precedence.

widgets:
~~~~~~~~

A sub-configuration of widgets that will be added to this slide when it's
created. See the examples above for details and syntax options.
