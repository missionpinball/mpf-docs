.. overview

The ``extra_balls:`` section of your config is where you configure
which events trigger and reset extra ball awards.

Note that this extra ball abstract device only takes care of awarding the
extra ball and can lit a light when enabled/available.
The logic to qualify for an extra ball has to be implemented in your mode.
See :doc:`/game_logic/extra_balls/index` for more details.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! config: mode1

   extra_balls:
       my_mode_eb:
           award_events: alien_smashed

In the above example, the extra ball called ``my_mode_eb`` will be
given to the player when the event ``alien_smashed`` is posted. After that,
future ``alien_smashed`` events will not lead to additional extra balls. (The
``my_mode_eb`` extra ball is "used up", in a sense).

This is all tracked per-player in a player variable dictionary called "extra_balls_awarded"
