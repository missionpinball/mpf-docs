The ``sound_loop_sets:`` section of your config is where you pre-define "named"
sound loop sets for playback in a sound loop audio track using sound_loop_player
section of a config file.

Sound loop sets are special groupings of existing sound assets (See the
:doc:`/config/sounds` reference page for more details on sound assets.)

.. rubric:: Example 1: Simple Sound Loop Set

If you want to define a sound loop set that is made up of only a single sound, you can just
add the sound name to the sound loop set. In the example below, we're defining a sound loop
set called *basic_beat* that references the sound asset named *kick*.  This is the simplest
sound loop set definition you can have.  The volume of the *kick* sound will be taken from
the sound asset definition.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   sound_loop_sets:
       basic_beat:
           sound: kick

.. rubric:: Option 2: Sound Loop Set With Multiple Layers

When specifying multiple layers use a dash (and a space) to dictate where a new layer starts,
like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   sound_loop_sets:
       basic_beat:
           sound: kick
           volume: 0.5
           tempo: 130.0
           layers:
             - sound: hihat
               volume: 0.7
               initial_state: stop
             - sound: snare
               volume: 0.6
               initial_state: stop
             - sound: clap
               volume: 0.45
               initial_state: stop
           events_when_played: basic_beat_played
           events_when_stopped: basic_beat_stopped
           events_when_looping: basic_beat_looped
           fade_out: 1s

       basic_beat2:
           sound: kick2
           volume: 0.5
           tempo: 130.0
           layers:
             - sound: hihat
               volume: 0.7
             - sound: snare
               volume: 0.6
             - sound: clap
               volume: 0.4
               initial_state: stop
             - sound: bass_synth
               volume: 0.5
               initial_state: play
           fade_out: 1s


Required settings
-----------------

The following sections are required for each named sound loop set in your config:

sound:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``.

The name of the sound asset that will be used as the master sound in the sound loop set.
This must refer to an existing sound asset or an error will be thrown during
initialization.  The sound asset also must be stored in memory (and not streaming). Do
not include the sound file extension here, only the sound asset name.

Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``sound_loop_sets:`` section of your config. (If
you don't include them, the default will be used).

volume:
~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``gain setting`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering gain values </config/instructions/gain_values>`)
-inf, db, or float between 0.0 and 1.0. Default: Uses the volume setting of the sound asset
specified in the ``sound:`` setting.

The volume of the specified sound (overrides the setting in the sound asset section).  This value
only controls the master sound and not any layers defined in the sound loop set.  As with all
volume parameters in MPF, this item can be represented as a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 is max
volume, 0.0 is off, 0.9 is 90%, etc.) It also can be represented as a decibel string from -inf to
0.0 db (ex: ``-3.0 db``).

events_when_played:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this sound loop set is played.
Enter the list in the MPF config list format. These events are posted exactly as they’re entered.

events_when_stopped:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this sound loop set stops playing.
Enter the list in the MPF config list format. These events are posted exactly as they’re entered.

events_when_looping:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this sound loop set loops back to the
beginning while playing. Enter the list in the MPF config list format. These events are posted
exactly as they’re entered.

fade_in:
~~~~~~~~

Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The number of seconds over which to fade in the sound loop set when it is played.

fade_out:
~~~~~~~~~

Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The number of seconds over which to fade out the sound loop set when it is stopped. This value is
not applied when the sound stops on its own by reaching the end of the sound. It only comes into
play when the sound is actively stopped by an event. A fade out sounds much more professional than
an abrupt cutoff of a sound.

tempo:
~~~~~~

Single value, type: ``float``. Default: ``60.0``

The tempo of the sound loop set, expressed in beats per minute. This setting is used to calculate
the timing of beat intervals when switching between sound loops. This setting only needed when using
the ``timing: next_beat_interval`` setting in the (:doc:`sound_loop_player </config/sound_loop_player>`).

layers:
-------

The ``layers:`` section controls the additional sound layers for the sound loop set.  It contains
the following nested sub-settings:

Required settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections are required in the ``layers:`` section of your config:

sound:
^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``string``.

The name of the sound asset that will be used in the sound loop set layer. This must refer to
an existing sound asset or an error will be thrown during initialization.  The sound asset
also must be stored in memory (and not streaming). Do not include the sound file extension
here, only the sound asset name.

Optional settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following sections are optional in the ``layers:`` section of your config. (If you don't
include them, the default will be used).

volume:
^^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``gain setting`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering gain values </config/instructions/gain_values>`)
-inf, db, or float between 0.0 and 1.0. Default: Uses the volume setting of the sound asset
specified in the layer ``sound:`` setting.

The volume of the specified sound in the layer (overrides the setting in the sound asset section).
As with all volume parameters in MPF, this item can be represented as a number between 0.0 and 1.0
(1.0 is max volume, 0.0 is off, 0.9 is 90%, etc.) It also can be represented as a decibel string
from -inf to 0.0 db (ex: ``-3.0 db``).

initial_state:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Single value, type: one of the following options: play, stop. Default: ``play``

The ``initial_state:`` of a sound loop set layer determines the initial play state for
the layer when the sound loop set is played. Options for ``initial_state:`` are:

+ ``play`` - The layer will be played whenever the sound loop set begins playback.
+ ``stop`` - The layer will be stopped whenever the sound loop set begins playback.
