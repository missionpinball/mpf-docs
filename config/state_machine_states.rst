.. overview

The ``state_machine_states:`` section of your config is where you configure the states of your :doc:`state machine <state_machines>`.

See :doc:`state machines </game_logic/logic_blocks/state_machines>` for details.


Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``state_machine_states:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

events_when_started:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``.

The event will be posted when the state machine enters this state.
This is the entry action for this state in your finite state machine.

events_when_stopped:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``.

The event will be posted when the state machine leaves this state.
This is the exit action for this state in your finite state machine.

label:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``.

The full name/description of this state.

show_when_active:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: :doc:`show_config <show_config>`.

A show which is played when the state machine is in this state.
This is kind of an entry action as you could use ``events_when_started`` and
a :doc:`show_player` to achieve the same.
It is meant as a helper because it is common to play one show per step.
