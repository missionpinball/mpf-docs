.. overview

The ``snux:`` section of your config is where you configure the
:doc:`snux platform </hardware/snux/index>`.

This is an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   hardware:
       platform: virtual	# use your platform here
       driverboards: wpc
       coils: snux
   
   system11:
       ac_relay_delay_ms: 75
       ac_relay_driver: c_ac_relay
   
   snux:
       flipper_enable_driver: c_flipper_enable_driver
       diag_led_driver: c_diag_led_driver
       platform: virtual	# use your platform here
   
   coils:
       c_diag_led_driver:
           number: c24
           default_hold_power: 1.0
       c_flipper_enable_driver:
           number: c23
           default_hold_power: 1.0
       c_ac_relay:
           number: c25
           default_hold_power: 1.0
       c_side_a1:
           number: c11a
       c_side_a2:
           number: c12a
           default_hold_power: 0.5
       c_side_c1:
           number: c11c
       c_side_c2:
           number: c12c
           default_hold_power: 0.5


Required settings
-----------------

The following sections are required in the ``snux:`` section of your config:

diag_led_driver:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a ``coils:`` device.

The coil to use to drive the diag LED on the snux board.

flipper_enable_driver:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a ``coils:`` device.

System 11 does not support any rules in software since the CPUs were too slow
at that time. Instead, they use a relay to enable flippers, pop bumpers and
slingshots.
Configure the driver to use to enable the flipper enable relay.

Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``snux:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

prefer_a_side_event:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value.  The name of an event that will make the AC relay sit on the 'A' side when at rest.  Default: ``game_ended``
Generally when the game is idle, the AC relay should be de-energised, so it sits on the 'A' side.

prefer_c_side_event:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value.  The name of an event that will make the AC relay sit on the 'C' side when at rest.  Default: ``game_starting``
Generally when the game is in play, the AC relay should be energised, favouring the 'C' side which generally handles the flashers.  This means they respond quickly without the need to wait on the relay being energised.

platform:
~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``None``

:doc:`WPC Platform </hardware/existing_machines/wpc>` to connect to the
:doc:`SNUX board </hardware/snux/index>`.
