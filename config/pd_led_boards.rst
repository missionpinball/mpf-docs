.. overview

The ``pd_led_boards:`` section of your config is where you configure your PD-LED boards connected to your
:doc:`P-Roc or P3-Roc </hardware/multimorphic/index>`.
See :doc:`/hardware/multimorphic/servos`, :doc:`/hardware/multimorphic/steppers` or
:doc:`/hardware/multimorphic/leds` for details.

Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``pd_led_boards:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).
