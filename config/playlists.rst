.. overview

The ``playlists:`` section of your config is where you configure non-default parameter values for any
playlist assets you want to use in your game. (This section is part of the MPF media controller and
only available if you're using MPF-MC for your media controller.)

Here is an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   playlists:
     playlistIntro:
       shuffle: false
       repeat: false
       sounds:
         - voiceAnnouncerNewsFlash1
         - voiceAnnouncerMessage1
         - voiceAnnouncerAliensAttack1

     playlistHighScore:
       shuffle: true
       repeat: true
       crossfade_mode: override

Required settings
-----------------

The following sections are required for each named sound loop set in your config:

sounds:
~~~~~~~

The ``sounds:`` section contains an indented list of existing sound assets (one per line) that will
be contained in the playlist. It is suggested you use block sequence notation for this list (begin
each line with a dash followed by a space). Alternatively, you can enter the sound asset names
in a comma-separated list. The sounds will be played in the order specfied (unless ``shuffle:`` is
set to ``True``).

.. note:: If you want to use a sound that has spaces in its name, the name of the sound must be
   in quotes:
   ::

    playlists:
       mode_music:
          sounds:
             - song_01
             - song_02
             - "song 03" # example of a sound with a space in its name using quotes
             - song_04
