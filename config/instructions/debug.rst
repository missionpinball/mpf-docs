Understanding the debug: setting
================================

Almost every device and platform in MPF contains a ``debug`` setting.
If you set this to ``True`` MPF will generate more log output for this device.
This may greatly increase the log size and decrease performance.
Enable it if you got problems with a certain device or platform to debug
problems later on.
