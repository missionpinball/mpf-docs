Machine config files
====================

Some config sections can only be used in your machine-wide configs.
Others can only exist in :doc:`mode_config <mode_config>` or some in either of them.
Those are usually hardware related and/or exist outside of the game.
You can see if this is the case at the top of the relevant
:doc:`config </config/index>` section.
For instance :doc:`lights </config/lights>` are defined machine-wide because
they are used throughout the whole lifecycle of a machine.
