Gamma correction in MPF
=======================

MPF includes functionality to allow you to adjust the gamma of the color
information that is sent to physical DMDs (RGB and mono) and to RGB LEDs.
(You don't need to set the gamma of an LCD display since that's handled by
your OS.)

You can read full details in the `Gamma correction <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction#Power_law_for_video_display>`_
article on Wikipedia, but the quick explanation is that the human eye doesn't
not perceive a change in brightness at the same ratio that an LED sets its
brightness.

When you're setting colors in MPF, you expect that 100% brightness looks
fully bright, and that 50% looks like 50%, etc. Here is a screenshot of a
slide which has 16 bars which fade from off to fully white, in a more-or-less
even fashion:

.. image:: /config/images/good_gamma.png

However if you show this slide on your physical DMD with no gamma correction,
it looks something like this:

.. image:: /config/images/bad_gamma.png

Even though the individual pixels are showing their "correct" brightness, the
human eye can't really tell a different between 50% and 100%, and pretty much
everything on the right half of the DMD looks fully white.

So you can adjust this by setting the gamma value. By default, MPF uses a
gamma value of 2.5 for RGB LEDs, and 2.2 for RGB DMDs. (It also uses a value
of 1.0 for mono DMDs since some of the hardware controllers do their own
internal gamma correction, though others don't, so you might have to change
them.

We recommend you read the documentation for the :doc:`/config/dmds`,
:doc:`/config/rgb_dmds`, and :doc:`/config/light_settings`
(for LEDs) to set the proper gamma.

Tuning your DMD gamma
---------------------

MPF includes a built-in gamma test slide (the one used in the images above)
which you can use to dial-in your gamma setting.

The easiest way to show this slide on your physical DMD is to make a
temporary addition to your machine config to add a slide player, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slide_player:
      mode_attract_started:
         dmd_gamma_test:
            priority: 10000000

This will just show the gamma test slide at a crazy high priority so it shows
on top of everything else. (Remember if your DMD is not your default display,
you'll also have to add ``target: dmd`` or whatever you use to target slides
to your DMD.)

Now you can play with different gamma settings for your DMD in either your
``dmds:`` or ``rgb_dmds:`` section. (Note you'll have to
restart MPF after each change you make.)

Note that you might also have to adjust ``brightness:`` along with ``gamma:``.
For example, some people had to set the brightness of their RGB DMDs to a
super low value, like ``0.1`` or ``0.2`` before MPF had gamma control, but
with proper gamma settings, you can probably take your brightness up to
somewhere around ``0.5``.

We like to use the gamma test slide and set the brightness first based on the
right-most brightest block, and then once that's set, we start messing with
the gamma. It will probably be some trial-and-error, but once it's dialed in
it's a "set it and forget it" type of thing.
