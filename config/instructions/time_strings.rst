How to enter time strings in config files
=========================================

You machine configuration files are full of settings which require time values
to be entered, such as “10 seconds” or “250 milliseconds.”

Rather than arbitrarily decide which values should be entered as seconds versus
milliseconds, we’ve built MPF so that you can enter either one whenever a time entry
is needed which MPF will internally convert to the proper value.

These time values are used all over the place. (Ball device count delays, ball save time,
ball search settings, reset delays, slide expiration times, etc.)

We’ll use an example from a ball device for the ``ball_count_delay:`` setting.
(Again, this is just an example. You use these same options whenever you need to
enter a time value):

Entering a time duration in seconds
-----------------------------------

To enter a time duration in seconds, simply add an “s” or “sec” after your number.
(This can be uppercase or lowercase and you can put a space in between your number
and the letters if you want.) Some examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ball_count_delay: 0.5s

   ball_count_delay: 0.5 S

   ball_count_delay: 0.5sec

Entering a time duration in milliseconds
----------------------------------------

To enter a time duration in seconds, simply add an “ms” or “msec” after your number.
(This can be uppercase or lowercase, and you can put a space in between your number and
the letters if you want.)

Note that if you do not enter and letters, then MPF will read in the time duration in
whatever the default scale is for that particular setting. (The instructions for each
setting should say whether the default is seconds or ms.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ball_count_delay: 500ms

   ball_count_delay: 500 MS

   ball_count_delay: 500msec

   ball_count_delay: 500

It makes no difference whether you enter your time durations as seconds or milliseconds,
as MPF will convert everything to milliseconds (since that's the default for *ball_count_delay*
when it reads in your configuration files.

Entering a time duration in minutes, hours, or days
---------------------------------------------------

You can also enter time strings in MPF for time periods longer than seconds or milliseconds.
While this isn’t practical for things like ball device delays, it’s used in certain modules
(like the credits module) for some settings.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   credit_expiration_time: 2m     # 2 minutes

   credit_expiration_time: 2h     # 2 hours

   credit_expiration_time: 2d     # 2 days
