Case insensitivity in config files
==================================

Setting names config files are case sensitive (starting with 0.50).
In 0.17 to 0.33 settings were case insensitive but it caused many
problems and thus has been dropped. Generally, a safe approach is to 
use only lower case in config files, though, it is fine to use upper
case in slides.  Using lower case is recommended for naming 
modes, devices, timers, etc....
