.. overview

The ``state_machine_transitions:`` section of your config is where you configure the transitions of your :doc:`state machine <state_machines>`.

Transitions will only be available if the state machine is in one of the states listed in ``source``.
In that case the machine will transition to the state listed in ``target``.
See :doc:`state machines </game_logic/logic_blocks/state_machines>` for details.

The following sections are required in the ``state_machine_transitions:`` section of your config:
