.. overview

A "light_rings" will create "count" lights for you starting the number at
"number_start". If you need a prefix or suffix for the number you can use
"number_template". All settings in "light_template" will be applied to all lights.
The only difference between :doc:`light_stripes </config/light_stripes>`  and
:doc:`light_rings </config/light_rings>` is how the x/y coordinates are computed.

Required settings
-----------------

The following sections are required in the ``light_rings:`` section of your config:

count:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``.

The integer value for how many LEDs are in the ring.

light_template:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: :doc:`lights <lights>`.

This is a list of sub-settings (indented) that are regular settings from the
:doc:`lights` section of your machine config. Any settings that are valid there
are valid here, and they're applied to all the LEDs in the ring.

number_start:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``.

The integer value for the number for the first LED in the ring. (MPF assumes
that all the LEDs in the ring are numbered sequentially.)


Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``light_rings:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

center_x:
~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``number`` (will be converted to floating point).

The "x" position of the center of the ring. (This is not used in MPF yet.)

center_y:
~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``number`` (will be converted to floating point).

The "y" position of the center of the ring.

number_template:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``.

MPF automatically configures the LEDs in a ring. The first one uses the
``number_start:`` value, and then it counts up from there up through the
``count:`` value.

However, many hardware numbers for LEDs are not just vanilla numbers, rather
they also include a board number or channel or something like that. The
``number_template:`` is where you specify what that number value looks like.
Just use braces ``{}`` for the part you want replaced by a number.

The example config with a number template of ``7-{}`` with a number start of
200 and a count of 5 will create 5 LEDs with the numbers 7-200, 7-201, 7-202,
7-203, and 7-204.

radius:
~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``number`` (will be converted to floating point).

The radius of the ring (in relative size to the x/y coordinates of the
``center_x:`` and ``center_y:`` positions. This is used for
the calculation of x/y positions of individual LEDs only.

start_angle:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``number`` (will be converted to floating point). Default: ``0``

The angle (in degrees, 0-360) of the first LED in the right. This is used for
the calculation of x/y positions of individual LEDs only.

console_log:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full. Default: ``basic``

Log level for the console log for this device.

debug:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Set this to true to see additional debug output. This might impact the performance of MPF.

file_log:
~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full. Default: ``basic``

Log level for the file log for this device.

label:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``%``

Name of this device in service mode.

tags:
~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``.

Not used.
