.. overview

The ``flippers:`` section of your config contains all the settings
for the flippers in a pinball machine.

Here's an example from a *Judge Dredd* machine with four
flippers. (Note *Judge Dredd* technically has four flipper buttons too,
but it's the style where you push the button part way in to flip the
lower flipper, and all the way in to flip the upper flipper too. But
as far as the game code is concerned, it sees two separate switches in
each flipper buttonâ€”-one that's activated via the half-press, and the
second via the full press.)

Also note that flippers are kind of complex and there are a lot of options.
Read the :doc:`/mechs/flippers/index` tech note for details. (You
should definitely read that first before digging into the configuration
options here.)

.. note::

   The ``flippers:`` section of the config is only used for controlled flippers
   in newer machines. Early solid-state (pre-WPC) machines used enable relays
   to enable the flippers, and those are configured elsewhere. (See the How To
   guides for details.)

Required settings
-----------------

The following sections are required in the ``flippers:`` section of your config:

main_coil:
~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a :doc:`coils <coils>` device.

The name of the main flipper coil. For flippers that only have single-
wound coils, this is where you specify that coil. In that case you
would also configure the lower-power hold option for this coil in the
:doc:`/config/coils` section of your config.


Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``flippers:`` section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

activation_switch:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a :doc:`switches <switches>` device.

The switch that controls this flipper (i.e. the flipper button).
This setting is optional because you can also use ``sw_flip_enable`` below but
``activation_switch`` is far more common and recommended instead.

ball_search_hold_time:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``time string (ms)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`). Default: ``1s``

How long this flipper will be activated for when it is activated during ball search.

ball_search_order:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``integer``. Default: ``100``

A relative value which controls the order individual devices are pulsed when ball search is running. Lower numbers are
checked first. See the :doc:`/game_logic/ball_search/index` documentation for details.

disable_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`). Default: ball_will_end, service_mode_entered

(Note that if you add an entry here, it will replace the default.
So if you also want the default value(s) to apply, add them too.)

Disables this flipper (meaning pushing the flipper button doesn't active
the flipper).

enable_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`). Default: ball_started

(Note that if you add an entry here, it will replace the default.
So if you also want the default value(s) to apply, add them too.)

Enables this flipper.

eos_switch:
~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a :doc:`switches <switches>` device.

EOS switch on this flipper (if there is one).

eos_switch_overwrite:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, each in the format of ``string`` : ``string``
If you're using an end of stroke switch with this flipper, enter the
switch name here.

hold_coil:
~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a :doc:`coils <coils>` device.

The name of the hold coil winding for dual-wound flipper coils.

hold_coil_overwrite:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: :doc:`coil_overwrites <coil_overwrites>`.

Overwrites settings on the hold_coil.
See :doc:`coil_overwrites` for details.

include_in_ball_search:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Controls whether this flipper is included in ball search.

Usually flippers aren't included in ball search. However if you have upper flippers,
it's probably good to include them in the ball search since it's often possible for
an upper flipper to disable and hold a ball under the flipper. Usually this isn't
an issue since the player can just flip to release the ball. However if the machine has
tilted (or the flippers are otherwise disabled), then it's possible for a flipper to
come down on the ball and get it stuck. So you definitely want to include upper flippers
in ball search.

BTW, this is something that happened to us in *Wizard of Oz*, so that's how we thought
to include an option for flippers in ball search. :)

main_coil_overwrite:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: :doc:`coil_overwrites <coil_overwrites>`.

Overwrites settings on the main_coil.
See :doc:`coil_overwrites` for details.

playfield:
~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: string name of a :doc:`playfields <playfields>` device. Default: ``playfield``

change this value if you have more than one playfield and you're managing them separately.

power_setting_name:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``.

A :doc:`machine setting </config/settings>` to use to adjust the (relative) power.
It can be used to allow the operator to adjust the power in service mode.

This is an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   coils:
       c_flipper_main:
           number:

   switches:
       s_flipper:
           number: 1
           tags: left_flipper

   flippers:
       f_test_flippers_with_settings:
           main_coil: c_flipper_main
           power_setting_name: flipper_power
           activation_switch: s_flipper

MPF comes with a :doc:`setting </config/settings>` called ``flipper_power`` by
default and you can add additional ones.

sw_flip_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

If the flipper is enabled this will flip the flipper from software.
This will usually have some delay and jitter so use with care.
In almost all cases it is prefered to use an ``activation_switch`` which will
use hardware rules internally to flip the flipper.

sw_release_events:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
List of one (or more) device control events (:doc:`Instructions for entering device control events </config/instructions/device_control_events>`).

Disables a flipper from software. Use this together with ``sw_flip_events``.

switch_overwrite:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One or more sub-entries, each in the format of ``string`` : ``string``
Overwrites settings on the activation_switch.
See :doc:`switch_overwrites` for details.

use_eos:
~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Controls whether an EOS switch is used to disable the main winding or to switch
to lower-power pwm mode.

console_log:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full. Default: ``basic``

Log level for the console log for this device.

debug:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

See the :doc:`documentation on the debug setting </config/instructions/debug>`
for details.

file_log:
~~~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full. Default: ``basic``

Log level for the file log for this device.

label:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``%``

A descriptive name for this device which will show up in the service menu
and reports.

tags:
~~~~~
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``.

Special / reserved tags for flippers: *None*

See the :doc:`documentation on tags </config/instructions/tags>` for details.
