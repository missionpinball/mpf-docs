.. note:: This section can also be used in a show file in the ``sound_loops:`` section
          of a step.

.. overview

The ``sound_loop_player:`` section of your config is where you specify actions to perform
on :doc:`sound loop sets <sound_loop_sets>` when MPF events are received.

Examples:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   sound_loop_player:
     play_basic_beat:
       loops:
         action: play
         sound_loop_set: basic_beat
         timing: loop_end
     add_hi_hats:
       loops:
         action: play_layer
         layer: 1
         timing: loop_end
     stop_hi_hats:
       loops:
         action: stop_looping_layer
         layer: 1
     add_snare:
       loops:
         action: play_layer
         fade_in: 2s
         layer: 2
         timing: now
     add_claps:
       loops:
         action: play_layer
         layer: 3
         timing: loop_end

:doc:`sound_player </config_players/sound_loop_player>` documentation.

Express configuration
---------------------

The ``sound_loop_player`` does not support an express configuration.

Required settings
-----------------

The following sections are required in the ``sound_loop_player:`` section of your config:

track:
^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``string``.

This is the name of the track on which to perform the specified action. This must be an existing
sound loop track. (You configure tracks and track names in the
:doc:`sound_system: </config/sound_system>` section of your machine config files.)

Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``sound_loop_player:`` section of your config.
(If you don't include them, the default will be used).

action:
^^^^^^^
Single value, type: one of the following options: play, stop.

The ``action:`` setting controls what action will be performed on the specified sound loop set. The
other settings for each action vary (additional details may be found below). Options for ``action:``
are:

+ ``play`` - The specified sound loop set will be played. Additional settings control whether the
  playback will begin immediately or after the currently playing loop set reaches the end of the
  master sound. Will cross-fade with the currently playing sound loop set if a ``fade_in`` setting
  is used.
+ ``stop`` - The currently playing sound loop set will be stopped.  Will fade out before stopping if
  a ``fade_out`` setting is used.
+ ``stop_looping`` - Looping will be cancelled for the currently playing sound loop set (the sound loop
  set will continue to play to the end of the current loop).
+ ``play_layer`` - Plays the sound on the specified layer in the currently playing loop set. Additional
  settings control whether the layer will begin immediately or will wait until after the currently
  playing loop set reaches the end of the sound. Will fade in if a ``fade_in`` setting is used.
+ ``stop_layer`` - Stops the sound on the specified layer in the currently playing loop set.  Will fade
  out before stopping if a ``fade_out`` setting is used.
+ ``stop_looping`` - Looping will be cancelled for the sound on the specified layer in the currently
  playing sound loop set (the sound on the layer will continue to play to the end of the current loop).

Settings for *play* action:
---------------------------

Only the ``sound_loop_set:`` setting is required for the *play* action.

sound_loop_set:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``string``.

This is the name of the ``sound_loop_set`` asset used to perform the specified action. This must
be the name an existing ``sound_loop_set`` specified in the ``sound_loop_sets:`` section of your
machine config files.  This setting is required for the *play* action.

timing:
^^^^^^^
Single value, type: one of the following options: ``now``, ``loop_end``, ``next_beat_interval``,
``next_time_interval``. Default: ``loop_end``

The ``timing:`` setting determines when the specified sound loop set should be played. If the sound
loop track is not currently playing any sound, this value is ignored and the sound loop is played
immediately.  Options for ``timing:`` are:

+ ``now`` - Play the specified sound loop set immediately, even if another sound loop is currently
  playing. If the ``fade_in:`` parameter has a non-zero value, the sound loops will be cross-faded
  over the ``fade_in:`` time interval.
+ ``loop_end`` - Play the specified sound loop set as soon as the currently playing sound loop reaches
  the end of the loop. This will be a gapless switch. The ``fade_in:`` setting is ignored when ``loop_end``
  is used.
+ ``next_beat_interval`` - Switch to the specified sound loop set on a beat interval of the currently
  playing sound loop. In order for this to work well the ``tempo:`` setting must be accurately set in
  all sound_loop_set assets. This setting works in conjunction with the ``interval:`` setting to
  determine the next beat interval to use when switching sound loops.  For example, a setting of ``1``
  indicates the switch can occur on any beat while a setting of ``4`` indicates the sound loops may
  only be switched every 4 beats (counted from the beginning of the currently playing sound loop set).
  This is useful to ensure sound loop sets are switched only at musically useful times.
+ ``next_time_interval`` - Switch to the specified sound loop set on a time interval of the currently
  playing sound loop. This setting works in conjunction with the ``interval:`` setting to determine
  the next time interval to use when switching sound loops.  For example, a setting of ``1``
  indicates the switch can occur on any second boundary while a setting of ``2.5`` indicates the sound
  loops may only be switched every 2.5 seconds (counted from the beginning of the currently playing
  sound loop set).

interval:
^^^^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``float``. Default: ``1``

Used in conjunction with the ``timing: next_beat_interval`` and ``timing: next_time_interval`` setting
values, this setting determines the next beat or time interval to use when switching sound loop sets.

synchronize:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``boolean`` (Yes/No or True/False). Default: ``False``

Indicates whether or not the sound loop will be synchronized in time with the currently playing sound
loop. This setting only applies when using the ``timing: now`` setting value. It most useful to
smoothly cross-fade between different variations of the same sound loop.

volume:
^^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``gain setting`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering gain values </config/instructions/gain_values>`)
-inf, db, or float between 0.0 and 1.0. Default: None (Uses the volume setting of the sound_loop_set asset
specified in the ``sound_loop_set:`` setting.

The volume of the specified sound loop master sound (overrides the setting in the sound asset section).
This value only controls the master sound and not any layers defined in the sound loop set.  As with all
volume parameters in MPF, this item can be represented as a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 is max
volume, 0.0 is off, 0.9 is 90%, etc.) It also can be represented as a decibel string from -inf to
0.0 db (ex: ``-3.0 db``).

fade_in:
^^^^^^^^

Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The number of seconds over which to fade in the sound loop set when it is played (when cross-fading between sound
loops).

fade_out:
^^^^^^^^^

Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The number of seconds over which to fade out the sound loop set when it is stopped. This value is
not applied when the sound stops on its own by reaching the end of the sound. It only comes into
play when the sound is actively stopped by an event. A fade out sounds much more professional than
an abrupt cutoff of a sound.

start_at:
^^^^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The position in the sound loop file (in seconds) to start playback of the sound loop when it is played. When
the sound loop is looped it will loop back to the beginning of the sound file.

events_when_played:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``use_sound_loop_setting``

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this sound loop set is played.
Enter the list in the MPF config list format. These events are posted exactly as they’re entered.
When set to ``use_sound_loop_setting``, the ``events_when_played:`` setting value specified in
the sound loop set will be used.

events_when_stopped:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``use_sound_loop_setting``

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this sound loop set stops playing.
Enter the list in the MPF config list format. These events are posted exactly as they’re entered.
When set to ``use_sound_loop_setting``, the ``events_when_stopped:`` setting value specified in
the sound loop set will be used.

events_when_looping:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
List of one (or more) values, each is a type: ``string``. Default: ``use_sound_loop_setting``

A list of one or more names of events that MPF will post when this sound loop set loops back to the
beginning while playing. Enter the list in the MPF config list format. These events are posted
exactly as they’re entered. When set to ``use_sound_loop_setting``, the ``looping:`` setting value
specified in the sound loop set will be used.


Settings for *stop* action:
---------------------------

No settings are required for the *stop* action.

fade_out:
^^^^^^^^^

Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The number of seconds over which to fade out the sound loop set when it is stopped. This value is
not applied when the sound stops on its own by reaching the end of the sound. It only comes into
play when the sound is actively stopped by an event. A fade out sounds much more professional than
an abrupt cutoff of a sound.


Settings for *stop_looping* action:
-----------------------------------

There are no settings available for the *stop_looping* action.


Settings for *jump_to* action:
------------------------------

The ``time:`` setting is required for the *jump_to* action.

time:
^^^^^
Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The position in the sound loop file (in seconds) to immediately jump to during playback of the current
sound loop. When the sound loop reaches the end of the sound, it will loop back to the beginning of the
sound file.


Settings for *play_layer* action:
---------------------------------

The ``layer:`` setting is required for the *play_layer* action. This action has no effect if there
is no sound loop set currently playing on the specified track.

layer:
^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``integer``.

An integer value that specifies which layer number of the currently playing sound loop set should
be played. Layers are numbered beginning with 1.

timing:
^^^^^^^
Single value, type: one of the following options: ``now``, ``loop_end``. Default: ``loop_end``

The ``timing:`` setting determines when the specified layer should be played. Layers are always
played in synchronized time with the master sound in the currently playing sound loop set. Options
for ``timing:`` are:

+ ``now`` - Play the specified layer immediately. If the ``fade_in:`` parameter has a non-zero value,
  the layer will faded in over the ``fade_in:`` time interval.
+ ``loop_end`` - Play the specified layer as soon as the currently playing sound loop reaches
  the end of the loop. If the ``fade_in:`` parameter has a non-zero value, the layer will faded in over
  the ``fade_in:`` time interval.

volume:
^^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``gain setting`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering gain values </config/instructions/gain_values>`)
-inf, db, or float between 0.0 and 1.0. Default: None (uses the volume setting of the sound asset
specified in the layer ``sound:`` setting.

The volume of the specified layer sound (overrides the setting in the sound asset section).  As with all
volume parameters in MPF, this item can be represented as a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 is max
volume, 0.0 is off, 0.9 is 90%, etc.) It also can be represented as a decibel string from -inf to
0.0 db (ex: ``-3.0 db``).

fade_in:
^^^^^^^^

Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The number of seconds over which to fade in the sound loop set layer when it is played.


Settings for *stop_layer* action:
---------------------------------

The ``layer:`` setting is required for the *stop_layer* action. This action has no effect if there
is no sound loop set currently playing on the specified track or if the specified layer is not
currently playing.

layer:
^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``integer``.

An integer value that specifies which layer number of the currently playing sound loop set should
be stopped. Layers are numbered beginning with 1.

fade_out:
^^^^^^^^^

Single value, type: ``time string (secs)`` (:doc:`Instructions for entering time strings </config/instructions/time_strings>`).
Default: ``0``

The number of seconds over which to fade out the sound loop set layer when it is stopped.


Settings for *stop_looping_layer* action:
-----------------------------------------

The ``layer:`` setting is required for the *stop_looping_layer* action. This action has no effect if there
is no sound loop set currently playing on the specified track or if the specified layer is not
currently playing.

layer:
^^^^^^
Single value, type: ``integer``.

An integer value that specifies which layer number of the currently playing sound loop set should
be stopped when the sound loop set master sound reaches the end. Layers are numbered beginning with 1.
