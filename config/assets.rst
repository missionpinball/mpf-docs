.. overview

The ``assets:`` section of a config file lets you
configure the default settings for different types of assets based on
what folder those assets are in. Any settings you specify here are
just the defaults, though, and you can still override the defaults for
an individual asset by adding an entry for it to your machine or mode
config file.

Let's take a look at an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   assets:
       images:
           default:
               load: preload
           preload:
               load: preload
           on_demand:
               load: on_demand
           potato:
               some_key: some_value
               something_else: whatever

The above config contains the asset settings for *image* assets. Notice
there are 4 entries under ``images:``: ``default``, ``preload``, ``on_demand``,
and ``potato``. Those names represent sub-folders that could contain image
assets.

Then under each of those, there are one or more key/value pairs. These key/value
pairs are applied to assets located in the sub-folders above.

.. note:: Although you can create sub-folders nested as many levels deep as you
   wish, only the top-level sub-folder can be listed in the assets section. Any
   assets in sub-folders below the top level will inherit the settings from
   their top-level sub-folder parent.

The ``default`` entry is special, as it applies to the root folder as well as
any assets that are in folders that are not specified here.

Consider the following files & folders in a machine folder with the ``assets:`` section
from above:

.. image:: images/image_asset_folder_structure.png

In this case, ``/your_machine/images/hello.jpg`` would have the ``default:`` settings
applied, ``/your_machine/images/preload/special.jpg`` would have the ``load: preload``
key/value pair applied to it, ``/your_machine/images/potato/toppings/cheese.jpg`` would
have the ``some_key: some_value`` and ``something_else: whatever`` key/value pairs
applied to it, etc.

The ``assets:`` section of the config file doesn't really care what the key/value pairs are. They're
just the defaults for the assets in those folders, and if they're not valid settings then MPF will
give you an error. (Note that different types of assets have different settings options and
different keys & values that are correct.)

Currently MPF supports four kinds of assets. Click on each to go to that asset type's description
in the config file reference which will explain what settings and be used and what the options are.

Asset types include:

+ :doc:`/config/shows` (use file_shows entry)
+ :doc:`/config/images`
+ :doc:`/config/sounds`
+ :doc:`/config/videos`
