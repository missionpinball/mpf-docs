.. note:: This section can also be used in a show file in the ``blinkenlights:`` section of a step.

.. overview

The ``blinkenlight_player:`` section of your config is where you add or remove
colors to or from a blinkenlight based on events. It's also used in shows
(via the ``blinkenlights:`` section) to add or remove colors in that show step.

Example from a config file:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    blinkenlight_player:
      some_event:
        my_blinkenlight1:
          action: add
          color: red
          key: mykey1
      some_other_event:
        my_blinkenlight1:
          action: remove
          key: mykey1

In the example above, when the event called ``some_event`` is posted,
the color red will be added to my_blinkenlight1's list of colors (this will
cause the light to immediately start flashing if it wasn't already).  The new
color will have the key ``mykey1``.  The key is used like a name of the color,
so that it can be removed later using that key.
When the event ``some_other_event`` is posted, the red color (key ``mykey1``) will be
removed from the blinkenlight.

Example blinkenlight player from a show:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    ##! show: test
    - time: 0
      blinkenlights:
        my_blinkenlight1:
          action: add
          color: blue
          key: blue_color
        my_blinkenlight2: purple

The first example shows the full config, while the second shows the
"express" config. (What's an "express config?" Details :doc:`here </config/instructions/express_config>`.

The blinkenlight player's express config is the "add" action.

See :doc:`/config_players/blinkenlight_player` for details.

Optional settings
-----------------

The following sections are optional in the ``blinkenlight_player:`` section of
your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

action:
~~~~~~~
Single value, type: one of the following options: add, remove, remove_mode, remove_all.
Default: ``add``

What action the blinkenlight should perform. The ``remove_all``
action will remove all the colors from the blinkenlight, effectively turning it
off.  The ``remove_mode`` action will remove all the colors that were added by
the mode that the ``remove_mode`` action is coming from (remember that a
blinkenlight can have colors added from lots of different modes -- that's its
whole purpose!).

color:
~~~~~~
Single value, type: ``string``. Default: ``white``

The only action that requires a color setting is the ``add`` action.  It sets
the color to add to this blinkenlight. Color values may be a hex string
(e.g. ``22FFCC``), a list of RGB values (e.g. ``[50, 128, 206]``), a color name
(e.g. ``turquoise``), or a brightness value (i.e. ``AA`` or ``120``).
MPF knows 140+ standard web color names, and you can define your own custom
colors in the :doc:`/config/named_colors` section of your config.
If you use brightness on an RGB light MPF will use the brightness for every
channel.
For instance brigness ``AA`` will result in color ``AAAAAA``.

key:
~~~~
Single valid, type: ``string``. Defaults to empty.

You can think of this value as a name for the color you're adding or removing
from the blinkenlight.  If you add a color, then the key allows you to remove
the color later using the key to specify which color to remove.  If you don't
specify a key, then the color is considered "keyless" (see
:doc:`/config_players/blinkenlight_player` for more information about keyless colors).
