The MPF Unity BCP Server
========================

The MPF Unity BCP Server is a Unity 3D-based media controller for MPF. You can use it if you want to program your
machine's graphics and sounds via Unity 3D. (If you haven't read about what a media controller is and how it fits into
MPF, :doc:`do that first <index>`).

MPF's Unity BCP Server is also free & open source, and hosted in the `unity-bcp-server repo <https://github.com/missionpinball/unity-bcp-server>`_
in the Mission Pinball GitHub account. See the readme in that repo for more details including instructions on how to
use it.
