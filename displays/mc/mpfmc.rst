The MPF Media Controller
========================

The MPF media controller (which we call "MPF-MC") is the default media controller option that 99% of MPF users use.
(If you haven't read about what a media controller is and how it fits into MPF, :doc:`do that first <index>`).

Like MPF, the MPF-MC is also written in Python, using a Python-based multimedia framework called `Kivy <http://kivy.org>`_.
Kivy is a wrapper for the native graphics & sound libraries on your computer, and it leverages the latest technologies
including SDL2, Gstreamer, and OpenGL.

All of the tutorials and installation guides included in this documentation explain how to install and use the MPF-MC,
so there's really nothing to know about it other than it's probably the one you're using.
