Working with Displays
=====================

The first step to setting up a display in MPF is to use the ``displays:``
section of your machine-wide config to create a list of displays.

Note that the Tutorial includes a walk-through of setting up your first
display. So if you just want to get it up and running quickly, check out the
:doc:`tutorial </tutorial/index>` instead and then come back here for the
nitty-gritty details later.

Here's a very simple example that creates a display called "window" with a
height and width of 800x600:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   displays:
      window:
         width: 800
         height: 600

You can name your display whatever you want. For example, here's a display called "potato" which is
100x100:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   displays:
      potato:
         width: 100
         height: 100

You can add multiple displays to your config. Here's an example with a display
called "lcd" which is 1366x768, and a second display called "playfield" which
is 640x480:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   displays:
      lcd:
         width: 1366
         height: 768
         default: true
      playfield:
         width: 640
         height: 480

The "lcd" display above also has a setting ``default: true``. As you
can imagine, when you have more than one display, then when you are setting up
content to be shown on the display, you have to specify which display you want
it to show up on. Picking one display to be your default is the display that's
used for content where you don't explicitly set which display you're using.

.. note::

   Full details and options for these displays are available in the
   :doc:`displays: section </config/displays>` of the config file reference.

.. rubric:: These "displays" are logical, not physical!

One concept that's somewhat confusing for new users is that the displays you set
up here are not yet tied to physical displays in your pinball machine. You can
think of these as "logical" displays which you can use in your config files and
game code. But when it comes to using a physical display, you have to "link"
the physical display hardware to one of these logical displays.

One final note about the displays you specify in your ``displays:`` section:
The size (height and width) of your displays here are independent from the
actual physical displays (windows and DMDs). For example, the size of the
on-screen window is specified in the ``window:`` section of the machine config
(which is 800x600 by default). So if you change the size of your display here
(perhaps to 320x240), then the on-screen window will still be 800x600, and the
content of the display canvas will be 320x240 (but scaled up to the 800x600
window). This means that MPF is "resolution independent", in that you can build
your game for a certain display size and then scale it up or down to
fit on whatever physical display is there later.

Let's walk through some examples of how you can actually configure various
displays. You don't have to read through all of theseâ€”just pick whichever
display type you want to use in your machine.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   lcd
   dmd
   rgb_dmd
   adding_dot_look_to_lcd
   alpha_numeric
   multiple_screens

.. rubric:: A note on performance with "displays" and "dmds"

If you have a physical DMD defined (in the :doc:`dmds: </config/dmds>` or
:doc:`rgb_dmds: </config/rgb_dmds>` of your machine config) and are emulating
the DMD's slides and widgets in your window, be aware that the MPF media
controller will process the graphics data for the physical DMD *even when MPF
is running in "virtual" mode*.

Although that graphics data will not be sent to a physical DMD, processing it
provides a more realistic MPF experience because of the considerable CPU power
required to convert on-screen graphics to DMD data.

If you are planning to use a physical DMD at some point on your project, it's
recommended to configure one *before* you start designing your slides and widgets.
Especially if you will be running virtually for the bulk of your early game design:
you don't want to spend time designing intricate slides and high-resolution
graphics only to find your CPU crumble when you finally attach a physical DMD.
