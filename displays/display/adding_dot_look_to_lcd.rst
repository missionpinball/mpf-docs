How to give your on-screen window the DMD "dot look"
====================================================

This guide will show you how to configure a full screen "dot look" display,
like this:

.. image:: /displays/images/dot_look_full_screen.png

The final sections of the machine config to make this happen are here:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    displays:
      window:
        width: 800
        height: 600
      dmd:
        width: 120
        height: 90
        default: yes

    slides:
      window_slide:
        - type: display
          effects:
           - type: color_dmd
             pixel_size: .5
          width: 800
          height: 600
      dmd_slide:
        - type: text
          text: DOTS!
        - type: rectangle
          width: 120
          height: 30
          color: orange
          y: 0
          anchor_y: bottom
        - type: rectangle
          width: 120
          height: 30
          color: red
          y: top
          anchor_y: top

    slide_player:
      init_done:
        window_slide:
          target: window
        dmd_slide:
          target: dmd

Let's step through this step-by-step.

1. Create your displays
-----------------------

To understand how this works, you have to understand the concepts of MPF
:doc:`displays </displays/display/index>` and
:doc:`widgets </displays/widgets/index>`.

What's actually happening under the hood is that you set up two MPF displays.
The first is the "window", which is the display that represents your on-screen
window. This should be set to the size of the screen window at the native
resolution of the monitor or LCD where it's being shown.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    displays:
      window:
        width: 800
        height: 600
      dmd:
        width: 120
        height: 90
        default: yes

In the example above, this is 800x600, but on your actual machine, it will
probably be something like 1024x768, 1280x1024, 1600x1200, etc.

The second MPF display represents the virtual DMD itself, and you set that to
the number of pixels (or dots) you want to be drawn in your window. In the
example above, this is set to 120x90, meaning the virtual DMD is 120 dots wide
and 90 dots tall. You can make this anything you want.

The key to remember is that the parent window will be using its pixels to draw
the individual dots that make up the virtual DMD. So a smaller DMD resolution
means the window has more pixels to use per-dot, resulting in a better overall
image.

For example, if we zoom in on the 120x90 virtual DMD being shown on an 800x600
window, we'll see that it looks like this:

.. image:: /displays/images/dot_look_zoom_in_6_to_1.png

This works because there is about a 6x6 grid of pixels in the window for each
virtual pixel in the DMD.

But if you increased the virtual DMD to 400x300 (instead of 120x90), that would
mean you only had a 2x2 window area to render each pixel, and it wouldn't really
work because you can't draw a circle with space around it in a 2x2 pixel.

Also note that we added ``default: yes`` to the dmd display, since as we get
deeper into the machine config, we want all the content (the slide_player, etc.)
to show up in the DMD display.

2. Create your window slide
---------------------------

Once you have your displays configured, the next step is to create the slide
that will be shown in the window. In this case, the slide will only have a
single widget, and that widget will be the Color DMD widget which will be used
render the virtual DMD into the window.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    slides:
      window_slide:
        - type: display
          effects:
           - type: color_dmd
             pixel_size: .5
          width: 800
          height: 600

We decided to name this slide "window_slide", though you can name it
whatever you want.

Note that in this case, we set the width and height of the color_dmd widget so
that it's the same size as the window itself. This is what causes it to be
scaled to the full size of the window.

We do *not* set the number of dots in the DMD here, as that's automatically
pulled in from the dmd display setting.

We also do not need to set a source display for the color_dmd widget since it
will automatically use a display called "dmd".

3. Create your DMD slide
------------------------

Next, we need a slide to show in the DMD itself. This is just something we're
setting up here as an example "first slide". In your actual game, this slide
will be ever changing and will reflect what's happening in your machine.

We're calling our first slide "dmd_slide":

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
      dmd_slide:
        - type: text
          text: DOTS!
        - type: rectangle
          width: 120
          height: 30
          color: orange
          y: 0
          anchor_y: bottom
        - type: rectangle
          width: 120
          height: 30
          color: red
          y: top
          anchor_y: top

There's nothing special about this slide. We just added a text widget and
two colored rectangles.

4. Configure your slides to show up
-----------------------------------

Finally, we need to create a slide_player entry which will cause the two slides
we just created to be shown. In this example, we're using the
:doc:`init_done event </events/init_done>` since that's the event that's posted
by the media controller once it's been initialized and ready to go.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    slide_player:
      init_done:
        window_slide:
          target: window
        dmd_slide:
          target: dmd

Since the DMD display is configured to be the default, when you use the
slide_player in the rest of your game, you won't have to specify
``target: dmd``. We just included it here to make it clear that we were
targeting the window slide to the window display and the dmd slide to the dmd
display.

5. Other options & positioning your DMD
---------------------------------------

Finally, remember to check the documentation for the :doc:`display widget </displays/widgets/display/index>` and the
:doc:`color_dmd effect </displays/widgets/display/effects>` for a full list of
the options you can use to fine-tune how the DMD looks in the window. For
example, you can configure the pixel size, the glow radius, the color of the
space between the pixels, gain, tint, etc.

Also, you don't have to make the virtual DMD be the full size of the display.
For example, if you set your dmd display to be 128x32 and then set the color_dmd
widget to be 640x160, you'll get a display like this:

.. image:: /displays/images/display_color_dmd2.png

You can also use the
:doc:`widget sizing and positioning </displays/widgets/positioning>` to
create a DMD widget that is pre-positioned at a certain spot on the display.
This is useful if you have a standard size LCD monitor in your backbox but only
part of it is visible to the player. In that case you could make a color_dmd
widget that was the size of the viewable area and use the widget positioning
settings to align it to the area of the display that was visible.

You can also use the various :doc:`window: </config/window>` options (such as
full screen) to properly align the content of the display with the visible area.

Finally, even though this example was using the color_dmd widget, you could
replace it with the :doc:`display widget </displays/widgets/display/index>` with a :doc:`dmd effect </displays/widgets/display/effects>` for a
single color look instead of full color.
