Displays, DMDs, & Graphics
==========================

Every electronic pinball machine has some type of display, whether it's
1980s-style 7-segment numeric displays, an early '90s-style alphanumeric
display, a mono dot matrix display (DMD), a full color "RGB" DMD, or a modern LCD (which itself
can either be a small LCD, like a "color DMD", or a huge one like what Jersey
Jack has in the backbox of The Wizard of Oz and The Hobbit).

The MPF media controller is designed so that it can support all types of these
displays, including multiple different types of displays at the same time. It
supports text, drawing shapes, images, and videos. You can position any
combination of these on the display at any time, and you can set layering and
transparencies. You can use standard TrueType fonts. You can also apply
animations, motions, and transitions to your displays and their widgets. And,
like just everything else in MPF, you can do most of your display configuration
via the config files.

.. note::

   Everything in this "Displays & Graphics" section is about the default MPF Media Controller.
   See the :doc:`media controller <mc/index>` section for details and alternative implementations.

Here are a few photos of the MPF Media Controller's display system in action.
These were all created with configuration files and without manual programming.

Here's a traditional :doc:`single-color / mono DMD <display/dmd>`:

Here's an on-screen window (or what many people called an "LCD" display. In this
case, it's showing on single :doc:`color DMD <display/rgb_dmd>` virtually with no "dot" filter applied,
along with other on-screen content:

.. image:: images/display_window.jpg

Here's a "color" DMD on an LCD monitor. It's showing a 128x32 window of color
content, with a "dot look" filter to make it look like dots.

Here's a full-size window with the dot filter applied:

Here's a full-color RGB DMD LED matrix. (So it's like a color DMD, but a matrix of
2.5mm RGB LEDs rather than an LCD):

Before we go into the details of all the various display components, let's start
with an overview of how the MPF display architecture works. (If you don't care
about the details and just want to start using your display, you can jump
directly into our :doc:`step-by-step tutorial </tutorial/index>` which covers
how to get your display running.)

Additionally, MPF also supports
:doc:`segment displays and alpha numeric displays <display/alpha_numeric>`.
Both physically and virtually.
Another type of displays are :doc:`score reels </mechs/score_reels/index>`
which can also be controlled.
