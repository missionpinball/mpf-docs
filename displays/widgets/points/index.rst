Points Widget
=============

The points widget is used to draw points (individual square points) on a slide.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   slide_player:
      mc_ready:
         points_example:
         - type: points
           points: 50, 50, 75, 50, 100, 50
           pointsize: 2
           color: lime
         - type: points
           points: 400, 300
           pointsize: 3
           color: pink

Which results in the following:

.. image:: /displays/images/points.png

Settings
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: points
   points:
   pointsize:

.. note:: Points widgets also have "common" widget settings for position, opacity,
   animations, color, style, etc. Those are not listed here, but are instead covered in
   :doc:`common widget settings </displays/widgets/common_settings>` page.

Also remember that all widget settings can be controlled via
:doc:`widget styles </displays/widgets/styles>`, rather than
you having to set every setting on every widget.

The following points widget settings may be :doc:`animated </displays/widgets/animation>`: ``color:``,
``points:``, ``pointsize:``, ``opacity:``, ``rotation:``, and ``scale:``.

type: points
~~~~~~~~~~~~



points:
~~~~~~~

A list of the x,y coordinates of pairs of points.

pointsize:
~~~~~~~~~~

Floating-point number, default is ``1.0``.

The distance from the center of the point to the edge, so a value of 1.0 makes a point that's
two pixels wide. (This is kind of like the radius, though points are square so it's not
technically the radius. Probably there's some fancy math name for it.)
