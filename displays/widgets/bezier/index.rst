Bezier Curve Widget
===================

The bezier widget is used to draw a curved line on a :doc:`slide </displays/slides/index>`.
(Note that if you want to draw a straight line, you can use the :doc:`/displays/widgets/line/index`.)

Here's an example:

TODO This example just shows a blank slide in MPF 0.50?

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   slide_player:
     mc_ready:
        bezier_example:
         - type: bezier
           points: 10, 10, 150, 450, 300, 100, 790, 590
           color: lime
           thickness: 5
           cap: square
         - type: bezier
           points: 0, 600, 400, 400, 400, 0
           color: pink
           close: true
           joint: miter
           thickness: 10

Which results in the following:

.. note:: Bezier widgets also have "common" widget settings for position, opacity,
   animations, color, style, etc. Those are not listed here, but are instead covered in
   :doc:`common widget settings </displays/widgets/common_settings>` page.

Also remember that all widget settings can be controlled via
:doc:`widget styles </displays/widgets/styles>`, rather than
you having to set every setting on every widget.

The following bezier widget settings may be :doc:`animated </displays/widgets/animation>`: ``color:``,
``thickness:``, ``opacity:``, ``points:``, ``rotation:``, and ``scale:``.


type: bezier
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tells MPF that this is a bezier curve widget. This setting is required when using bezier curve
widgets.

points:
~~~~~~~

A list of points which make up the bezier curve, expressed in x/y pairs (so the
number of items here has to be even).

The first pair is the starting point. The last pair is the ending point.
Each pair in between is a point the curve will pass through.

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   points: 10, 10, 200, 50, 300, 200

This would draw a bezier curve starting at (10,10) and ending at (300,200), with a
center point at (200, 50).

thickness:
~~~~~~~~~~

The thickness of the line. You'll probably have to play with different settings
to get it right. The default is ``1.0``, so ``2.0`` is twice as thick as the
default, ``0.5`` is half as thick, etc.

cap:
~~~~

Determine the cap of the line, defaults to ‘round’. Can be one of ‘square’ or ‘round’

joint:
~~~~~~

Determine the join of the line, defaults to ‘round’.
Can be one of ‘none’, ‘round’, ‘bevel’, ‘miter’.

cap_precision:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer, defaults to 10.

Number of segments for drawing the “round” joint, defaults to 10.
The joint_precision must be at least 1.

joint_precision:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer, defaults to 10.

Number of segments for drawing the “round” joint, defaults to 10.
The joint_precision must be at least 1.

close:
~~~~~~

Boolean (True/False), default is ``False``.

If ``True``, the line will be closed.

precision:
~~~~~~~~~~

Integer, defaults to 180.

The number of individual segments that will be drawn between each pair of points.
