Config file for the easing GIF
==============================

In case you're wondering how we created the easing GIF files, here are the
complete MPF machine config for them.

First, here's the GIF where we set the easing for the x (horizontal position)
property and move them left and right:

.. image::  /displays/images/easing.gif

.. note::

   If you're viewing the PDF version of these docs, you won't see the GIFs since
   they're animated. You can view the docs online to see them.

In order to run this example, you do not need to run the MPF core engine, just
the MC. So name this file config.yaml and put it in a config folder, and then
run:

::

    mpf mc

Note that the graphs with the red lines on the right are not part of this
config, but it wouldn't be hard to add them.

Basically this file just creates a single display with a single slide with five
text widgets, sets up the animations for them, and then has a slide_player
entry to show that slide on the *init_done* event which is posted by the media
controller once it's ready to show slides. (That's why we don't need the MPF
core engine to run this example.)

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    # config_version=5

    displays:
      default:
        width: 400
        height: 300

    slides:
      slide1:
        - type: text
          text: linear (none)
          y: 90%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: x
              value: 205
              duration: 1s
              easing: linear
            - property: x
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: linear
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: in_out_quad
          y: 70%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: x
              value: 215
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_quad
            - property: x
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_quad
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: in_out_elastic
          y: 50%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: x
              value: 185
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_elastic
            - property: x
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_elastic
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: out_bounce
          y: 30%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: x
              value: 220
              duration: 1s
              easing: out_bounce
            - property: x
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: out_bounce
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: in_quint
          y: 10%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: x
              value: 275
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_quint
            - property: x
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_quint
              repeat: yes

    slide_player:
      init_done: slide1

And here's the example where we animate the opacity:

.. image:: /displays/images/easing_opacity.gif

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    # config_version=5

    displays:
      default:
        width: 400
        height: 300

    slides:
      slide1:
        - type: text
          text: linear (none)
          y: 90%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: opacity
              value: 1
              duration: 1s
              easing: linear
            - property: opacity
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: linear
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: in_out_quad
          y: 70%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: opacity
              value: 1
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_quad
            - property: opacity
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_quad
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: in_out_elastic
          y: 50%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: opacity
              value: 1
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_elastic
            - property: opacity
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_out_elastic
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: out_bounce
          y: 30%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: opacity
              value: 1
              duration: 1s
              easing: out_bounce
            - property: opacity
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: out_bounce
              repeat: yes
        - type: text
          text: in_quint
          y: 10%
          font_size: 35
          animations:
            show_slide:
            - property: opacity
              value: 1
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_quint
            - property: opacity
              value: 0
              duration: 1s
              easing: in_quint
              repeat: yes

    slide_player:
      init_done: slide1
