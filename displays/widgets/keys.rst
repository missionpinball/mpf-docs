Widget Keys
===========

Widget keys are used to uniquely identify instances of widgets which you can later use to
update or remove the widget.

Note that you can you can also identify widgets by name (which is almost always more
straightforward). You only need to use a key if you want to put multiple instances of the
same widget on the same slide, and then you need a way to identify a individual ones to
update or remove them.
