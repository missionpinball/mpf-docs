Ellipse Widget
==============

The ellipse widget is used to draw a solid ellipse (including circles) on a :doc:`slide </displays/slides/index>`.

It can also be used to draw "wedges" (pie slices) or ellipses with sections missing (like Pac Man).

Note that ellipses are always solid. If you want an elliptical outline,
use the :doc:`/displays/widgets/bezier/index`.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   slide_player:
    mc_ready:
       ellipse_example:
        - type: ellipse
          x: 200
          y: 200
          width: 200
          height: 200
          color: blue
          angle_start: 0
          angle_end: 90
        - type: ellipse
          x: 400
          y: 300
          width: 400
          height: 200
          color: yellow
          segments: 8
        - type: ellipse
          x: 600
          y: 500
          width: 400
          height: 300
          color: red
          angle_start: 200
          angle_end: 300
        - type: ellipse
          x: 700
          y: 200
          width: 90
          height: 300
          color: lime

And the result:

Settings
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

   width:
   height:
   segments:
   angle_start:
   angle_end:

.. note:: Ellipse widgets also have "common" widget settings for position, opacity,
   animations, color, style, etc. Those are not listed here, but are instead covered in
   :doc:`common widget settings </displays/widgets/common_settings>` page.

Also remember that all widget settings can be controlled via
:doc:`widget styles </displays/widgets/styles>`, rather than
you having to set every setting on every widget.

The following ellipse widget settings may be :doc:`animated </displays/widgets/animation>`: ``x:``, ``y:``, ``width:``,
``position:``, ``height:``, ``size:``, ``color:``, ``angle_start:``, ``angle_end:``, ``opacity:``, ``rotation:``, and ``scale:``.

type: ellipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tells MPF that this is an ellipse widget. This setting is required when using ellipse widgets.

width:
~~~~~~

The width (in pixels) of this ellipse. This setting is required.

The ``width:`` and ``height:`` settings set the bounding box that the
ellipse will be drawn in. If you want a circle, set the width and height
to be the same.

height:
~~~~~~~

The height (in pixels) of this ellipse. This setting is required.

segments:
~~~~~~~~~

The number of segments that will make up the ellipse. More segments will
create a smoother edge, but depending on the size of your display and the
size of the ellipse, you might not see much of a difference.

The default is ``180``.

angle_start:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The angle, between 0-360, where the ellipse will start. The default is ``0``.

angle_end:
~~~~~~~~~~

The angle, between 0-360, where the ellipse will start. The default is ``360``.

Note that a start angle of 0 and an end angle of 360 will create a complete
solid ellipse.
