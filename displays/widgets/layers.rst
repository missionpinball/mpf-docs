Widget layers, z-order, & parent frames
=======================================

When you have multiple widgets on a slide, you can control the layer
(or z-order) of the widgets, controlling which widgets are on top of others
in cases where two or more widgets overlap.

When adding a widget to an existing slide, you also have the option to add
it to the "parent frame" (and not to the slide), meaning that if the slide
changes, the widget will still be there.

Let's look at how all this works.

Overlapping widgets, layers, & z-order
--------------------------------------

Any time you have two widgets that overlap, MPF must decide which widget will
be drawn "on top" of the other.

At the most basic level, any time you have more than one widget listed in
a config (whether it's in a ``widget_player:``, ``slide_player:``, or
a definition in a ``slides:`` or ``widgets:`` section), the widgets will be
drawn in the order they are in the config.

For example, here's a slide that has widget3.1, then widget3.2, then
widget3.3:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
      3_widgets:
      - type: text
        text: widget3.1
        color: red
        font_size: 80
        y: 40%
      - type: text
        text: widget3.2
        color: orange
        font_size: 80
        y: 50%
      - type: text
        text: widget3.3
        color: violet
        font_size: 80
        y: 60%

The result is like this. Note that widget3.1 is on top of widget3.2, which is
on top of widget3.3:

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_layers_order.jpg

In this example, all three widgets are 100% opaque, but if any of them had
opacity of less than 100%, then you would see the lower level widget through
the higher one. See the :doc:`opacity` guide for details.

You can also use the ``z:`` setting to manually set the relative order of how
you want the widgets to overlap. Widgets with higher ``z:`` values will be
drawn on top of those with lower values.

Here's the same example as before, but with ``z:`` values added:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
      3_widgets:
      - type: text
        text: widget3.1
        color: red
        font_size: 80
        y: 40%
        z: 1
      - type: text
        text: widget3.2
        color: orange
        font_size: 80
        y: 50%
        z: 100
      - type: text
        text: widget3.3
        color: violet
        font_size: 80
        y: 60%
        z: 2

And the results:

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_layers_z.jpg

Note that *widget3.2* is on top since it's ``z:`` is 100, then *widget3.3* is
next with ``z: 2``, and finally *widget3.1* is on the bottom with ``z: 1``

Notes about z-order:

* The default ``z:`` value is ``0``, so anytime you have a widget without a
  ``z:`` setting, it's like you have ``z: 0``.
* The order the widgets are listed in the config file is only used as a
  tie-breaker if multiple widgets have the same ``z:`` settings. (This is why
  the first example worked, since all three widgets had ``z: 0``.)
* You can mix-and-match order and ``z:`` settings.
* The actual numeric ``z:`` settings don't matter. You can have 1, 2, 3 or
  100, 200, 300, or 1, 20000, 1000000 or whatever you want.
* Setting ``z:`` values for widgets on a slide is only really used if you want
  to later use the widget player to add a widget to a slide in between certain
  existing widgets.
* In most slides, you will not mess with ``z:`` settings and instead use the
  order of the widgets in the config file to set the order they are on the
  slide.

Adding widgets to parent frames
-------------------------------

When you use the ``widget_player:``, it will add the widget to the current
slide on the default display.

If you want to target a specific slide, you can add a ``slide:`` setting
to your widget player with the name of the slide.

In both cases, the widget player will add the widget to a slide.

However, it's also possible to add a widget to the "frame" which holds the
slides, meaning that the widget is shown "on top" of the slide rather than
as part of the slide.

Why would you want to do that?

Sometimes it's useful to have a widget which "stays put" even as the underlying
slides change.

One example is for tilt warnings. When the player gets a tilt warning, you
might want to show the text "WARNING" for 2 seconds. However if you use the
regular widget player to add this widget to the current slide, then if that
slide is replaced by another slide during those 2 seconds, your tilt warning
will disappear too.

Another example is the scores. Maybe you want those to show along the bottom
on top of every slide? Or maybe something like the news crawl on the bottom
of the *Dialed In* display?

So instead of using a ``slide:`` setting with your widget player, you can use
the ``target:`` setting and enter of name of a display. In that case, the widget
will be added there, and not to the slide, meaning your widget will ride "on top"
of the slides (and even on top of any slide transitions that take place).
