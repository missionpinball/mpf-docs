Line Widget
===========

The line widget is used to draw a straight line on a
:doc:`slide </displays/slides/index>`. (Note that if you want to draw a
curved line, you can use the :doc:`/displays/widgets/bezier/index`.)

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   slide_player:
    mc_ready:
       line_example:
        - type: line
          points: 0, 300, 800, 300
        - type: line
          points: 0, 100, 800, 100
        - type: line
          points: 400, 95, 400, 0
          color: red
          thickness: 5
          cap: square
        - type: line
          points: 100, 500, 150, 550, 200, 450
          color: lime
          thickness: 2
        - type: line
          points: 500, 150, 600, 350, 650, 200
          color: blue
          close: yes
          thickness: 3

And the results:

Settings
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: line
   points:
   thickness:
   cap:
   joint:
   cap_precision:
   joint_precision:
   close:

.. note:: Line widgets also have "common" widget settings for position, opacity,
   animations, color, style, etc. Those are not listed here, but are instead covered in
   :doc:`common widget settings </displays/widgets/common_settings>` page.

Also remember that all widget settings can be controlled via
:doc:`widget styles </displays/widgets/styles>`, rather than
you having to set every setting on every widget.

The following line widget settings may be :doc:`animated </displays/widgets/animation>`: ``color:``,
``thickness:``, ``opacity:``, ``points:``, ``rotation:``, and ``scale:``.

type: line
~~~~~~~~~~

Tells MPF that this is a line widget. This setting is required when using line
curve widgets.

points:
~~~~~~~

A list of point pairs which make up the line, expressed in x/y pairs (so the
number of items here has to be even).

For example:

::

   points: 10, 10, 200, 50, 300, 200

This would draw a line starting at (10,10) and going to (200, 50), and then
from there, going to (300,200). If you just want a single straight line, then
you would enter 4 values here: the x/y of the start and the x/y of the end.

thickness:
~~~~~~~~~~

The thickness of the line. You'll probably have to play with different settings
to get it right. The default is ``1.0``, so ``2.0`` is twice as thick as the
default, ``0.5`` is half as thick, etc.

cap:
~~~~

Determine the cap of the line, defaults to ‘round’. Can be one of ‘none’,
‘square’ or ‘round’.

joint:
~~~~~~

Determine the join of the line, defaults to ‘round’.
Can be one of ‘none’, ‘round’, ‘bevel’, ‘miter’.

cap_precision:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer, defaults to 10.

Number of segments for drawing the “round” joint, defaults to 10.
The joint_precision must be at least 1.

joint_precision:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integer, defaults to 10.

Number of segments for drawing the “round” joint, defaults to 10.
The joint_precision must be at least 1.

close:
~~~~~~

Boolean (True/False), default is ``False``.

If ``True``, the line will be closed.
