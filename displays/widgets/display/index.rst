The display widget is used to show the contents of a display on a slide :doc:`slide </displays/slides/index>`
or another display (think of this like a picture-in-picture kind of thing). To attempt to clear up any
confusion, there are two types of displays: a :doc:`display </displays/display/index>` which is basically an
in-memory target for for slides and widgets, and a display widget (this help topic) which enables the graphical
display of the previously mentioned type of display within its boundaries (it is the actual visual output of
the logical display).

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   displays:
     window:
       height: 200
       width: 600
     my_frame:
       width: 400
       height: 300
       default: true

   slides:
     base_slide:
       - type: display
         source_display: my_frame
         width: 400
         height: 300
         x: 300
         y: 200
       - type: text
         text: this is the base slide
         x: 600
         y: 400
     frame_slide:
       widgets:
         - type: text
           text: this is a slide in the frame
       background_color: red

   slide_player:
     mc_ready.1: base_slide
     mc_ready.2:
       frame_slide:
         target: my_frame

And the result:

Settings
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: display
   source_display:
   width:
   height:
   effects:

.. note:: Display widgets also have "common" widget settings for position, opacity,
   animations, color, style, etc. Those are not listed here, but are instead covered in
   :doc:`common widget settings </displays/widgets/common_settings>` page.

Also remember that all widget settings can be controlled via
:doc:`widget styles </displays/widgets/styles>`, rather than
you having to set every setting on every widget.

The following display widget settings may be :doc:`animated </displays/widgets/animation>`: ``x:`` ``y:``, and ``pos:``.

source_display:
---------------

The name of the logical display to show on the screen within the widget boundaries. This name
is available as a ``target:`` name is other areas of your configs when you want to target a
slide the specified display.

More information on display targets is :doc:`here </displays/slides/display_targets>`.

width:
------

The width of the frame in pixels.

height:
-------

The height of the frame in pixels.

effects:
--------

A list of effects to apply to the display contents. These effects perform image processing to the
source image and can be used to get an old school "DMD look" or "color DMD look" to your display
as well as other special effects.  For more information on effects, please review the
:doc:`effects </displays/widgets/display/effects>` documentation.

An example of a display widget with a dmd effect:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   slides:
     base_slide:
       - type: display
         source_display: dmd
         width: 640
         height: 160
         effects:
           - type: dmd
             dot_color: ff5500
