Rectangle Widget
================

The rectangle widget is used to draw a rectangle (or rounded rectangle) on a
slide. Remember that a square is just a rectangle whose height and width
are the same.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   slide_player:
     mc_ready:
        rectangle_example:
         - type: rectangle
           x: 200
           y: 200
           width: 200
           height: 200
           color: pink
         - type: rectangle
           x: 400
           y: 300
           width: 400
           height: 200
           corner_radius: 50
           corner_segments: 3
           color: yellow
         - type: rectangle
           x: 600
           y: 500
           width: 400
           height: 300
           corner_radius: 75
           color: red

Which results in the following:

Settings
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: rectangle
   width:
   height:
   corner_radius:
   corner_segments:

.. note:: Rectangle widgets also have "common" widget settings for position, opacity,
   animations, color, style, etc. Those are not listed here, but are instead covered in
   :doc:`common widget settings </displays/widgets/common_settings>` page.

Also remember that all widget settings can be controlled via
:doc:`widget styles </displays/widgets/styles>`, rather than
you having to set every setting on every widget.

The following rectangle widget settings may be :doc:`animated </displays/widgets/animation>`: ``x:``, ``y:``, ``width:``,
``height:``, ``color:``, ``corner_radius:``, ``opacity:``, ``rotation:``, and ``scale:``.

width:
~~~~~~

The width of the rectangle, in pixels.

height:
~~~~~~~

The height of the rectangle, in pixels.

corner_radius:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Number value of the radius of the corners (in pixels). Default is ``0`` which means
sharp square corners.

corner_segments:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For rectangles with rounded corners (where ``corner_radius:`` is greater than 1), how
many individual segments should make up the corner. The more segments, the smoother the
corner is.

Default is ``10``.
