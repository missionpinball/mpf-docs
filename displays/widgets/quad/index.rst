Quad Widget
===========

The quad widget is used to draw solid polygons on a slide.

Here's an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #config_version=5

   slide_player:
     mc_ready:
        bezier_example:
         - type: quad
           points: 210, 110, 210, 150, 500, 200, 590, 190
           color: pink
         - type: quad
           points: 50, 550, 400, 400, 400, 100, 200, 200
           color: lime

Which results in the following:

.. image:: /displays/images/quad.png

Settings
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

   type: quad
   points:

.. note:: Quad widgets also have "common" widget settings for position, opacity,
   animations, color, style, etc. Those are not listed here, but are instead covered in
   :doc:`common widget settings </displays/widgets/common_settings>` page.

Also remember that all widget settings can be controlled via
:doc:`widget styles </displays/widgets/styles>`, rather than
you having to set every setting on every widget.

The following quad widget settings may be :doc:`animated </displays/widgets/animation>`: ``color:``,
``points:``, ``opacity:``, ``rotation:``, and ``scale:``.

Tells MPF this is a quad widget.

points:

A list of 8 values representing x,y coordinate pairs for the four corners of the quad.

A list of the x,y coordinates of the corners. Note that to have a normal four-cornered
shape, the corners need to be in order. You can start with any one and go clockwise
or counter-clockwise, but if you enter the corners in a mixed order like 1, 3, 2, 4 then
it's possible your quad will fold over itself and look weird.
