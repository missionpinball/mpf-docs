How to position widgets on slides
=================================

Probably the most important thing to know about putting widgets on slides is how to position them.

1. Understanding MPF display coordinates
----------------------------------------

At the most basic level, every display slide has a resolution (always conveyed in the order width, then height), and
widgets have a position on slide (horizontal, then vertical).

* The dimensions of the slide are always described *width* (x), then *height* (y). (So a 128x32 display is 128 pixels
  wide and 32 pixels tall.)
* The "zero" position is the lower-left corner. (Just like an x-y cartesian coordinate graph from school.)
* Since the ``(0, 0)`` position is the actual location of the lower-left corner pixel, the upper-right pixel is actually
  one less than the width and height of your slide. (e.g. a display that's 128 pixels wide has x positions 0 through
  127.
* A widget's position is always described *horizontal* (x), then *vertical* (y). So a widget at position ``(10, 20)`` is
  10 pixels in from the left edge and 20 pixels up from the bottom.

Here's a simple example that illustrates this:

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_positioning_basics.png

By the way, in MPF, the actual "pixel size" of the display as MPF sees it is separate from actual pixels of the physical
display. So you could have a display in MPF that's 400x300 pixels, but you show that full size on an LCD that's 1920x1200
pixels. MPF will automatically scale the logical display to fit in the size of the window you configure on the physical
display. This is known as "resolution independence", and is nice if you ever have to replace your LCD in the future and
the new one you buy doesn't have the same resolution as your old one.

2. Understanding widget "anchors"
---------------------------------

In the diagram from the first step, the "position" of each widget is set based on its lower-left corner. In real life,
if you had to position every widget based on its lower-left corner all the time, you'd go crazy! For example, to
"center" a widget, you'd have to calculate what the x and y offsets were and then do some math, and then if you
animated the widget's size you'd have to recalculate it... it would be a mess!

Fortunately MPF does all this math for you.

When you configure a widget in MPF, you can config its "anchor" point (both ``anchor_x`` for the horizontal anchor and
``anchor_y`` for the vertical anchor.)

A widget's anchor setting tells MPF what point on the widget is used to position it on the slide. Here are some
examples which show how various anchor settings are applied to different widgets. The red bulls-eye target represents the
point that's used by MPF to position that widget with each type of anchor settings.

3. Combing anchors and widget positioning
-----------------------------------------

Now that you know how the coordinates and anchors work, let's look at some examples that combine these two concepts:

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_positioning_with_anchors_1.png

In the diagram above, you can see how the bulls-eye anchor target is the actual point of the widget that is positioned
with each widget's ``x:`` and ``y:`` settings.

You'll also notice that widgets can be fully or partially be positioned outside the boundaries of a slide. (This is
useful if you want to animate a widget "entering" the slide from off screen--you'd position the widget so it's outside
the bounds of the visible window and then animate it moving on.) Also note that positioning can be negative. Negative
x values are off the left edge of the slide, and negative y values are off the bottom.

As you look at this example, you can probably start to see that different anchors make sense for different types of
positioning. For example, if you have several widgets that you'd like to left-align, then it makes sense to set their
anchors to ``anchor_x: left`` and positioning them based on their left edge.

By default, MPF uses the center of the widget for the anchor. This is what you get if you do not include an ``anchor_x:``
or ``anchor_y:`` setting. (Also the terms ``middle`` and ``center`` are interchangeable in all widget anchor and
positioning settings.)

4. Relative positioning
-----------------------

Even though anchors are powerful, it can still be kind of confusing to position widgets based solely on ``x:`` and ``y:``
pixel values. After all, you constantly have to think about how big your display is and do lots of math to get your
values set.

Fortunately MPF can use relative positions for a widget's ``x:`` and ``y:`` values, as show here:

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_positioning_with_anchors_2.png

There are a lot of different options in this diagram, so let's go through them one-by-one.

First, for ``x:`` values, you can use:

* ``x: left`` - Positions the anchor of the widget at the left edge of the slide
* ``x: center`` - Positions the anchor of the widget in the horizontal center
* ``x: right`` - Positions the anchor on the right edge

You can also use percentage values. The percentages are automatically calculated based on the width of the slide. So if
you set ``x:50%`` and your slide is 800 pixels wide, the x value will be 400. (``x: 50%`` is the same as ``x: center``.)

For ``y:`` values, you can use:

* ``y: top`` - Positions the anchor of the widget at the top of the slide.
* ``y: middle`` - Positions the anchor of the widget in the vertical middle.
* ``y: bottom`` - Positions the anchor on the bottom edge.

Again, you can also use percentages.

What's really cool is you can *also* combine relative words with pixels and percentages. Some examples:

* ``x: center+10`` - Positions the x anchor of the widget 10 pixels to the right of the center position.
* ``x: center-10`` - Positions the anchor 10 pixels to the left of the center.
* ``y: top-10%`` - Positions the y anchor 10% below the top edge of the slide.

5. Try to use relative & percent positioning for everything
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you can manage to use relative (top/bottom/left/middle/etc.) and percentage values for everything, then your display
system will be completely resolution independent!

Remember we said that the logical size of a display in MPF can be scaled up to any size physical display. So if you
build your configs for a 1024x768 display, and then a few years down the line, you install a 1600x1200 monitor, you can
make one simple config change to tell MPF to scale your 1024x768 up to the 1600x1200 display. That's fine, but you
won't have a display that's as crisp as it can be because the graphics card will be scaling everything.

However, if you config all your widget positioning using only relative positions and percentages, then if you get a new
display in the future, you can change the native logical resolution of your display in MPF and then make full use of the
full resolution. It would be like everything instantly becoming high res!

6. Widget positioning offset adjustments
----------------------------------------

Another features of widget positioning in MPF is something known as an "offset adjustment". So far we saw how anchors
can be positioned in the middle or an edge of the widget. The offset adjusts let you fine-tune the position of the
anchor so it can be anywhere--including off the widget altogether!

Why would you want to do that? The main reason is that sometimes the technical edge of your widget is not exactly in
the position that makes the most logical sense. A good example of this is text widgets. Many fonts have bounding boxes
that are a few pixels bigger than the actual rendered text. For example, the text bounding box will allow for lower
case letters that hang down below the baseline, but most pinball machines only use uppercase letters. This makes it hard
to align the baseline of your font because there is random space under it:

Consider the following example where you want to align the bottom of the text with the bottom of the circle. The black
areas represent the visible pixels, and the gray area is the actual widget bounding box. Even though this font is small
(only 5 pixels tall, uses for small text on a DMD), it still has two blank rows of pixels below every letter. This means
that if you set the ``anchor_y: bottom`` on both your text and the circle, they will not actually be aligned:

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_bad_offset.png

What's even worst is that this font only has 1 extra row on top, so if you want to center-align it with another widget
you won't get the actual center of the visible text.

Fortunately MPF has a way to deal with this in the form of anchor adjustments. There are four adjustment values you can
configure for a widget:

* ``adjust_top``
* ``adjust_right``
* ``adjust_left``
* ``adjust_bottom``

All of these settings are optional. (They all default to ``0``.)

You might think it's weird that there are top, right, left, and bottom adjustments. Why not just have simple x and y
adjustments? The reason is because having four is easiest when you're actually laying out your slides. For example, you
might have a widget (like our text widget) with different amount of extra space on the top versus the bottom. So letting
you specify an offset for the top and a separate offset for the bottom means that you can anchor and position that
widget by either the top or the bottom and you don't have to mess with the adjusts each time. (It also means that center
anchors will actually be in the visual center of the widget.) In other words, you set your adjustments once and never
have to worry about them again.

For all the adjustments, positive values move the edge of the widget more towards the center (cutting off extra pixels),
and negative values move it more away from the center (adding padding)

Going back to the example from before, if we add ``adjust_bottom: 2``, that will move the adjustment point 2 pixels
towards the middle, meaning our bottom alignment now actually aligns:

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_good_offset.png

Negative values have the effect of adding padding to widgets, which can also be nice as you're aligning and distributing
things.

The only other thing to know about adjustments is that they only affect the positioning of the widget. Adjustments are
not cropping, and they will not "cut off" or "trim" the widget.

7. Widget position rounding
-------------------------------------------

Sometimes a center-anchored or percentage-based widget will end up at a position with a fractional pixel. High-resolution
displays have no trouble smoothing out partial pixels, but low-resolution displays (like DMDs) may render the widget blurry.

You can prevent MPF-MC from positioning widgets on pixel fractions with the ``round_anchor_x:`` and ``round_anchor_y:``
setting, either locally on a widget or globally on the display. When present, this setting will force MPF-MC to round
fractional anchor positions in the specified direction.

* ``round_anchor_x: left`` - Round the horizonal pixel position down
* ``round_anchor_x: right`` - Round the horizonal pixel position up
* ``round_anchor_x: center`` - Do not round the pixel position (default)
* ``round_anchor_y: bottom`` - Round the vertical pixel position down
* ``round_anchor_y: top`` - Round the vertical pixel position up
* ``round_anchor_y: center`` - Do not round the pixel position (default)

.. image:: /displays/images/widget_anchor_rounding.png

This setting is valid on ``widgets`` and ``displays``. If you have a display and a widget both configured for rounding,
the widget's setting will take priority.

8. Widget positioning can be done in styles
-------------------------------------------

One of the powerful features of widgets in MPF is that you can configure widget styles, which are like buckets of
settings that are applied and merged into widget settings. You can put any widget settings you want in a style (and then
specify the style to be applied to a widget in the ``style:`` setting in a widget config, a slide config, a show, or
a widget player).

Styles can be used in several different ways. For example, you can configure a style for text widgets which has the
font name, font size, and adjustments so you can simply add ``style: big`` to a widget and everything will be there.

You can also put ``x:`` and ``y:`` settings in styles and use them to position and size the widgets on different parts
of your display. For example, you might have an area of the screen that always shows some kind of status message, and
even though that might be used throughout your game, you might always want the same font, alignment, size, and
positioning no matter what's there. So you can define a style called ``info_zone`` and then any text widget that uses
that style will always show up in the right place. (You can also use styles for z-order and animations, so you can use
a style to define popups and other things that you'll use over and over.)

See the How To guide on widget styles for details.

9. Putting it all together
--------------------------

So now you've seen all the options for positioning and placement of widgets. But how do you actually use them? Simple.
Everything discussed here are just regular widget settings. So you can use them in slides:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slides:
      slide1:
         widgets:
          - type: text
            text: MY WIDGET
            x: left+10%
            y: top-10%
            adjust_bottom: 2

You can use them in :doc:`named widgets <reusable_widgets>`:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   widgets:
      my_cool_widget:
       - type: text
         text: MY WIDGET
         x: left+10%
         y: top-10%
         adjust_bottom: 2

You can use them in the widget player:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   widget_player:
      some_event:
         my_widget:
            widget_settings:
               x: left+10%
               y: top-10%
               adjust_bottom: 2

And you can use them in shows:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: test_show
   - time: 1s
     widgets:
        my_widget:
           target: lcd
           widget_settings:
              x: top
              y: right-15.4%
