How to create slides
====================

Since slides are so critical in MPF's display system, let's look at how you
actually create slides.
You can test slides and widgets interactively using
:doc:`Interactive MC (iMC) </tools/imc/index>`.

There are several ways you can define and create slides:

* In a :doc:`/config/slides` section of a config file.
* Dynamically in the :doc:`/config/slide_player` section of your config.
* Dynamically in a show config or show file.

Let's look at each of these options.

Defining slides in the slides: section of a config file
-------------------------------------------------------

The main way to do it is in the "slides" section of a config file, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    slides:
        some_slide:
            - type: text
              text: THIS IS MY SLIDE
        some_other_slide:
            - type: text
              text: THIS IS ANOTHER SLIDE
            - type: text
              text: WITH MORE WORDS
              y: bottom
              anchor_y: bottom
        tilt_warning_1:
            - type: text
              text: WARNING
        tilt_warning_2:
            - type: text
              text: WARNING WARNING

In the example above, we have four main sub-entries in the slides section:

* some_slide
* some_other_slide
* tilt_warning_1
* tilt_warning_2

Each of the above listed subsections represents a different slide, and the names
of those sections are used as the names of those slides. In other words, this
config has a slide called "some_slide", another slide called "some_other_slide",
etc.

You can list slides in a :doc:`/config/slides` section of either your machine-wide or a
mode config. The most important thing to know about slide names is that they
are GLOBAL throughout MPF. That means that MPF has a single master list of all
the slide names used in the entire game. (So don't use the same slide name
twice or it will get confused.)

The configuration entries under each slide name are the widgets that will be
added to that slide. (Each slide can have one or more widgets. You can read
about all the different types of widgets, as
well as the options for widget positioning and sizing, in the
:doc:`widgets </displays/widgets/index>` section of the documentation.

You'll probably end up creating hundreds of slides in your machine by the time
you're done with it.

.. note::

   The slides defined in the :doc:`/config/slides` section are just the configurations
   that are used to create the slides when they're needed. In other words, no
   memory is used to "hold" the slides, so you can create lots and lots of them
   without worrying about running out of memory.

At this point, you're just creating the slides. Deciding when to show which
slide will come later.

Since MPF maintains a single global list of slides, it doesn't technically
matter whether you define your slides in the :doc:`/config/slides` section of your
machine-wide config or your mode config. Obviously though if you define the
slides a mode will use in that mode's config file, then that will help you
keep everything more organized.

Dynamically defining slides in a slide_player: section of a config file
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The :doc:`/config/slide_player` section of a machine-wide or mode config is where you
tell MPF to show (or "play") a specific slide when some event occurs. Full
documentation for the slide_player is in the
:doc:`showing_slides` section of the documentation.

You can define slides in the slide_player like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    slide_player:
        some_event:
            my_slide_1:
                - type: text
                  text: THIS IS MY SLIDE

In the above example, when the event *some_event* is posted, the slide player
will respond and show the slide called *my_slide_1* which will include that
single text widget.

It doesn't really matter whether you pre-define a slide in the :doc:`/config/slides`
section of a config versions dynamically defining it in the :doc:`/config/slide_player`
section. Really it comes down to personal preference. Some people like to have
all their slides in one location (all in the :doc:`/config/slides` section), whereas
others prefer to have the configuration for the slides closer to where they
will be used (by defining them in the :doc:`/config/slide_player` section). Most people
end up mixing-and-matching, with some quick-and-dirty one-time use slides in
the slide_player with other slides you might reuse in the slides: section.

Dynamically defining slides in a show config
--------------------------------------------

As you'll learn in other parts of this documentation, anything that's in one
of the "_player" sections of the config (like the "slide_player" above), can
also be defined in a show configuration (from a show file or a show
configuration section of a config file).

So here's an example of a slide created within a show for use within a specific
step in that show:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   # show_version=5
   - time: 0
     slides:
        my_show_slide_1:
        - type: text
          text: MISSION PINBALL
          color: red
        - type: rectangle
          width: 128
          height: 32

Again, see the :doc:`show documentation </shows/index>` for details. Here we're
just showing that it's also possible to define a slide in a show config.
