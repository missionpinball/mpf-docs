Slide Transitions
=================

When MPF switches the current slide on a display with another slide, you can
set a transition effect that controls what this slide transition looks like.
You can use these transitions with the slide_player and within shows. You can
set transitions as a property of the new slide that comes in, or as a property
of the outgoing transition when the current slide is removed. You can also
control the duration (speed) of the transition.

Here's a list of all the types of transitions that MPF supports. Note that if
you're reading the PDF or Epub version of this documentation, if you visit the
documentation website (docs.missionpinball.org) then this page contains
animated GIFs which show each of these transitions in action.

none
----

.. image:: /displays/images/no_transition.gif

Setting a transition type of ``none`` means that no transition will be used, and
the incoming slide instantly replaces the current slide.

push
----

.. image:: /displays/images/push_transitions.gif

The push transition means that the incoming slide "pushes" the outgoing slide
out of the way. (e.g. the outgoing slide moves out while the incoming slide
moves in)

Options for the push transition:

* duration: MPF :doc:`time string </config/instructions/time_strings>` Default is 1 second.
* easing: See the :doc:`easing instructions </displays/widgets/easing>` for details.
* direction: ``left``, ``right``, ``up`` or ``down``.

move_in
-------

.. image:: /displays/images/move_in_transitions.gif

The move in transition means that the incoming slide moves in on top of the
outgoing slide. The outgoing slide is not animated.

Options for the move_in transition:

* duration: MPF :doc:`time string </config/instructions/time_strings>` Default is 1 second.
* easing: See the :doc:`easing instructions </displays/widgets/easing>` for
  details.
* direction: ``left``, ``right``, ``top`` or ``bottom``.

move_out
--------

Not working yet.

wipe
----

.. image:: /displays/images/wipe_transition.gif

The wipe transition means that the display is wiped from the outgoing slide to
the incoming one. Neither slide is animated.

Options for the wipe transition:

* duration: MPF :doc:`time string </config/instructions/time_strings>` Default is 1 second.

swap
----

.. image:: /displays/images/swap_transition.gif

The swap transition similates an app screen swap like on a mobile device. The
outgoing slide moves out of the way and the incoming slide comes in on top of
it.

Options for the swap transition:

* duration: MPF :doc:`time string </config/instructions/time_strings>` Default is 1 second.

fade
----

.. image:: /displays/images/fade_transition.gif

The fade transition is a classic crossfade from the outgoing slide to the
incoming one.

Options for the fade transition:

* duration: MPF :doc:`time string </config/instructions/time_strings>` Default is 1 second.

fade_back
---------

.. image:: /displays/images/fade_back_transition.gif

The fade_back transition causes the outgoing slide to shrink and fade away,
revealing the incoming slide.

Options for the fade_back transition:

* duration: MPF :doc:`time string </config/instructions/time_strings>` Default is 1 second.

rise_in
-------

.. image:: /displays/images/rise_in_transition.gif

The rise in transition causes the incoming slide to fade in and rise up from
the center of the display. It's essentially the opposite of the fade_back
transition.

Options for the rise_in transition:

* duration: MPF :doc:`time string </config/instructions/time_strings>` Default is 1 second.

Configuring Transitions
-----------------------

Transitions are specified as an additional property of a ``slide_player:``
config or the ``slides:`` section of a show config. For example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    slide_player:
        left_ramp_hit:
            slide1:
                transition:
                    type: push
                    duration: 2s
                    direction: right

Hopefully the above example is obvious by now. When the event "left_ramp_hit"
happens, MPF will show the slide called "slide1:, using the push transition,
with a transition time of 2 seconds, pushing the new slide in from the right.

Transitions can be combined with other slide settings, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    slide_player:
        left_ramp_hit:
            slide1:
                transition:
                    type: push
                    duration: 2s
                    direction: right
                target: dmd

You can also configure ``transition_out:`` settings which are transitions that
will be applied to a slide when it is removed, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    slide_player:
        left_ramp_hit:
            slide1:
                transition:
                    type: push
                    duration: 2s
                    direction: right
                transition_out:
                    type: fade_away

.. note::
   If the current slide has a ``transition_out:`` setting, and the new slide has
   a ``transition:`` setting, then the new slide's transition setting will take
   precedence.
