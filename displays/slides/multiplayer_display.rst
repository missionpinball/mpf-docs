How to configure a multiplayer display
======================================

This is an example walkthrough of creating a "score" slide that dynamically
adjusts as additional players are added to the game, and displays custom player
variables in addition to ball number and score.

1. Game Modes vs Player Modes
-----------------------------

Unlike most events in MPF, adding players can occur both during a player's turn
and prior to it, so it's a good idea to run your base slide as part of the "game"
mode rather than inside a player-specific mode. This is easy to do by creating
a mode folder and config file for the game mode, which MPF will automatically
append to the default game configuration. You do not need to add any mode
start/stop events to game.yaml, as those are all taken care of internally.

2. Create a base "single_player" slide in game.yaml
---------------------------------------------------

.. image:: /displays/images/multiplayer_player_1.png

We'll start by creating the default single-player slide and showing it when the
game starts, which will always be single-player because a second player can't be
added until after the game starts.

We'll create each element of this slide as a separate widget, so we can remove
different pieces one-by-one as the number of players increases. In this example,
we have a large score for the current player, show the player's custom-variable
"level" in the lower-left, and their current ball number in the lower-right

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  slides:
    base_slide: []

  slide_player:
    single_player_ball_started: base_slide

  widgets:
    base_score_widget:
      - type: text
        text: (score)
        style: score_style_singleplayer
    base_level_widget:
      - type: text
        text: LVL (player|level)
        style: mp_player_3
    base_ball_widget:
      - type: text
        text: BALL (ball)
        style: mp_player_4

  widget_player:
    # First event, before additional players have a chance to enter
    game_started:
      base_score_widget:
        slide: base_slide
      base_level_widget:
        slide: base_slide
      base_ball_widget:
        slide: base_slide

This is all we need to have a nice single-player slide that shows the score, the
ball, and a custom game-specific player variable.

3. Add a Second Player
----------------------

With the addition of a second player we'll shrink the main score down a little,
and show a small player_1 indicator in the upper-left and a player_2 indicator
in the upper-right. Because the current player's score is already shown in the
middle, in this example we'll show another player variable (in this case, the
player's name) where their score normally is.

.. image:: /displays/images/multiplayer_player_2.png

The _multi_player_ball_started_ event happens when a player's turn starts and there
are multiple players in the game, so this will show our multiplayer slide at the
beginning of every ball.

The _multiplayer_game_ event happens as soon as a second player is added,
so we use it to swap the slides if player_2 joins after player_1 has already
started their turn.

Because the "game" mode exists between player turns, its slides can interfere
with other slide behavior (e.g. bonus slides and start/end of turn slides).
We'll keep it clean and manually clear the score slide at the end of each ball.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  slide_player:
    single_player_ball_started: base_slide
    multi_player_ball_started: multiplayer_slide
    # If a second player joins during player1's turn, swap base_slide for multiplayer_slide
    multiplayer_game:
      base_slide:
        action: remove
      multiplayer_slide:
        action: play
    ball_will_end:
      base_slide:
        action: remove
      multiplayer_slide:
        action: remove

With only two players, we can keep the "level" and "ball" widgets in the bottom
left and right corners. We want to add the player_1 and player_2 widgets in the
upper corners, and swap out the big "base_score_widget" for the slightly
smaller "mp_score_widget" one:

::

  widget_player:
    { ... game_started: ... }

    # Player 2 has entered the game
    player_added{num==2}:
      mp_score_widget:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      base_level_widget:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      base_ball_widget:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      # Start with player1 name and player2 score
      mp_name_widget_player_1:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      mp_score_widget_player_2:
        slide: multiplayer_slide

  widgets:
    { ... base_widgets ... }

    mp_score_widget:
      - type: text
        text: (score)
        style: score_style_multiplayer

    # Player 1 score, for when they're not playing
    mp_score_widget_player_1:
      - type: text
        text: (player1|score)
        style: mp_player_1
    # Player 2 score, for when they're not playing
    mp_score_widget_player_2:
      - type: text
        text: (player2|score)
        style: mp_player_2

    # Player 1 custom variable, for when they are playing
    mp_name_widget_player_1:
      - type: text
        text: (machine|last_career_player_1)
        style: mp_player_1
    # Player 2 custom variable, for when they are playing
    mp_name_widget_player_2:
      - type: text
        text: (machine|last_career_player_2)
        style: mp_player_2

4. Adding a third and fourth player
-----------------------------------

Since the multiplayer slide is already being shown, adding player_3 and player_4
is as easy as swapping out the "level" and "ball" widgets for player scores.

.. image:: /displays/images/multiplayer_player_4.png

::

  widget_player:
    { ... single and player_2 widget_player ... }

    # Player 3 has entered the game
    player_added{num==3}:
      mp_score_widget_player_3:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      # Remove the "Level" widget and place the player3 score
      base_level_widget:
        action: remove
        slide: multiplayer_slide

    # Player 4 has entered the game
    player_added{num==4}:
      mp_score_widget_player_4:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      # Remove the "Ball" widget and place the player4 score
      base_ball_widget:
        action: remove
        slide: multiplayer_slide

  widgets:
    { ... single and player_2 widgets .. }

    mp_score_widget_player_3:
      - type: text
        text: (player3|score)
        style: mp_player_3
    mp_score_widget_player_4:
      - type: text
        text: (player4|score)
        style: mp_player_4
    mp_name_widget_player_3:
      - type: text
        text: (machine|last_career_player_3)
        style: mp_player_3
    mp_name_widget_player_4:
      - type: text
        text: (machine|last_career_player_4)
        style: mp_player_4

5. Turn-by-turn display changes
-------------------------------

It's nice showing a custom player variable for the current player during their
turn, but we want to swap out that widget for their score after their turn ends.

Because we don't know how many players there will be, it's not safe to use the
next player's turn to reset the previous player's widget. Instead, we set each
player's custom variable widget at the start of their turn and reset their score
widget at the end of their turn.

::

  widget_player:
    { ... base and multi-player widgets ...}

    # Player Turns: Swap scores -> names when turn starts, revert when turn ends
    player_turn_started{number==1}:
      mp_score_widget_player_1:
        action: remove
      mp_name_widget_player_1:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
    player_turn_ended{number==1}:
      mp_score_widget_player_1:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      mp_name_widget_player_1:
        action: remove
    player_turn_started{number==2}:
      mp_score_widget_player_2:
        action: remove
      mp_name_widget_player_2:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
    player_turn_ended{number==2}:
      mp_score_widget_player_2:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      mp_name_widget_player_2:
        action: remove
    player_turn_started{number==3}:
      mp_score_widget_player_3:
        action: remove
      mp_name_widget_player_3:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
    player_turn_ended{number==3}:
      mp_score_widget_player_3:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      mp_name_widget_player_3:
        action: remove
    player_turn_started{number==4}:
      mp_score_widget_player_4:
        action: remove
      mp_name_widget_player_4:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
    player_turn_ended{number==4}:
      mp_score_widget_player_4:
        slide: multiplayer_slide
      mp_name_widget_player_4:
        action: remove
