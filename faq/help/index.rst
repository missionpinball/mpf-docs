FAQ: Getting help
=================

Where can I go for help?
------------------------

If you're stuck with something, feel free to post a message to the
`MPF Users Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_.

I think I've found a bug. Now what?
-----------------------------------

Again, post it to the `MPF Users Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_.

I want MPF to work with a new piece of hardware
-----------------------------------------------

Awesome! We've designed MPF to be platform-independent, meaning that the core MPF software doesn't talk
to hardware directly. Instead we have "platform interfaces" for different types of hardware.

The easiest way to understand how these work is to look through the code for the existing platform interfaces.
This code is in the `platforms folder in MPF <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/tree/dev/mpf/platforms>`_.

As always, if you have questions, please post them to the
`MPF Users Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_ and we'll go from there!
