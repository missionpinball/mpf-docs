FAQ: Installation
=================

How do I get started?
---------------------

Start with the :doc:`Start Here </start/index>` link in the menu on the left. That will explain an
overview of how MPF works and then lead you through the features, the tutorial, and so on.

What are the prerequisites?
---------------------------

If you just want to start playing with MPF, you do not need a physical pinball machine. In fact we have
a graphical tool (the `MPF Monitor <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-monitor>`_) which simulates
a real pinball machine, so you can probably build an entire game without having an actual pinball machine.

If you want to use a real pinball machine (or build a real machine), you need to pick a pinball control
system. (We have a list of supported control systems :doc:`here </hardware/index>`.) If you want to get
started as cheaply as possible, the Open Pinball Project hardware is open source which you can build
yourself. You can probably build all the hardware you need for under $100.

What computer hardware do I need?
---------------------------------

MPF supports Windows, Mac, and Linux, so pretty much any computer is fine. Most people do their development
of MPF on whatever computer they use in their daily lives, then when they're getting close to done with
their machine, they install a dedicated computer (or even a Raspberry Pi) in their machine to run MPF.

What Python version can I use with MPF?
---------------------------------------

Your need Python 3.5 or 3.6. Python 3.4 is end of life and will no longer be supported.
Python 3.7 and newer are not yet supported.
We walk you through getting Python installed in our :doc:`installation documentation </install/index>`.

Should I use the stable version or development version?
-------------------------------------------------------

We recommend that people use the latest "stable" (or "release") version of MPF unless you need specific
features from the "dev" (next) version.

The current "stable" version of MPF is listed on the top of the `MPF Users home page on Google Groups <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mpf-users>`_.

Where do I find information on older versions of MPF?
-----------------------------------------------------

If you want information about an older version (0.30 and newer), click the "Read the Docs" link in the
lower-left corner of any page on docs.missionpinball.org and select the version you want to read about.

You can install older versions of MPF with pip, like this:

::

   pip install mpf-mc==0.31

Documentation for versions of MPF prior to 0.30 is available in `this post <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mpf-users/7I-phnq9rOs/>`_
