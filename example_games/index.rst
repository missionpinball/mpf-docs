Example Machine Projects you can learn from
===========================================

The mpf-examples project
------------------------

Contains several examples of MPF configs you can run and learn from, including:

* :doc:`Demo Man <demo_man>`
* :doc:`MC Demo <mc_demo>`
* :doc:`Cookbook recipes </cookbook/index>`
* :doc:`Tutorial config files </tutorial/index>`

Full details about the mpf-examples project and how to download it are
:doc:`here <mpf-examples>`.


State Fair Pinball
------------------

An upcoming machine we're working on. Details: `<http://statefairpinball.com>`_.
GitHub repo: `<https://github.com/missionpinball/state_fair>`_

Brooks 'n Dunn
--------------

One of the projects we took on in 2015 was to rewire and build and MPF config for Gottlieb's Brooks 'n Dunn. (BnD).
BnD was the machine that Gottlieb was working on when they shut down in 1996.

This config is probably the most complete of any MPF project that's publicly available. However it contains lots of
licensed assets (music, videos, images, etc.) that are not in the public repo. This means you won't be able to
actually run it, but you can look through the configs (which are well commented) to see how we do things.

The BnD repo is at https://github.com/gabeknuth/bnd

Mass Effect 2
-------------

An extensive project to build a complete MPF game from scratch and play on a
re-skinned Game of Thrones cabinet (Spike platform), inspired by the video game
Mass Effect 2. With the exception of audio tracks extracted from the Mass Effect
2 data files, all of the game code is available to clone from the repo and run.
MPF monitor is supported so you can simulate gameplay without the Spike GoT hardware.

All of the project code is at https://github.com/avanwinkle/masseffect2
