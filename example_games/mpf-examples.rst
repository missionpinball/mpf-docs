How to download the mpf-examples bundle
=======================================

We maintain a GitHub repo called
`mpf-examples <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples>`_ which contains a
few different example MPF configs and some templates you can use.

The mpf-examples repo doesn't have an installer, rather, you just download it
and unzip it and start using the stuff it contains.

Each software repo in GitHub has several "branches". (Think of branches
kind of like versions.) The mpf-examples repo has multiple branches that
each match a specific version of MPF. For example, the 0.21 branch of the mpf-examples
repo is for MPF 0.21, the 0.30 branch is for MPF 0.30, etc.

Here are the direct links (to ZIP files) for the various branches of mpf-examples
that you can download based on your version of MPF:

* `0.21.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.21.zip>`_.
* `0.30.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.30.zip>`_.
* `0.31.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.31.zip>`_.
* `0.32.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.32.x.zip>`_.
* `0.33.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.33.x.zip>`_.
* `0.50.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.50.x.zip>`_.
* `0.51.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.51.x.zip>`_.
* `0.52.x <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/0.52.x.zip>`_.
* `dev <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/archive/dev.zip>`_.

Unzip the file to any location you want, and then browse the files to see what's there,
or open a console window to launch MPF and/or MPF MC in each folder.

``demo_man``
