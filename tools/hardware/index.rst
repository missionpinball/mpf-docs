MPF Hardware Command
====================

MPF allows has a few command line actions to check and update your hardware:

mpf hardware scan
-----------------

You can run `mpf hardware scan` to get an overview over the connected hardware.
MPF will try to enumerate all connected boards and tell you what it know about
your hardware.
The output varies per hardware platform from almost nothing to a lot.

mpf hardware firmware_update
----------------------------

MPF will try to upgrade the firmware of your hardware if this is supported for
your hardware.
There will probably be specific configuration in your hardware platform section
to enable this.

mpf hardware benchmark
----------------------

Overview video about mpf hardware benchmark:

.. youtube:: uRT--368J6A

MPF will benchmark latency and jitter of inputs, outputs and rules for your
hardware setup (i.e. your controller with your OS and hardware).
This needs to be configured:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
     s_test1:
       number:
     s_test2:
       number:

   coils:
     c_coil1:
       number:
     c_coil2:
       number:
       allow_enable: true

   flippers:
     f_flipper:
       activation_switch: s_test1
       main_coil: c_coil2

   hardware_benchmark:
     coil1: c_coil1
     coil2: c_coil2
     switch1: s_test1
     switch2: s_test2
     flipper: f_flipper


Disconnect or disable high voltage.
Then connect `s_test1` to `c_coil1` and `s_test2` to `c_coil2`.
MPF will enable the flipper `f_flipper` which will create a hardware rule on
`s_test1` to pulse `c_coil2`.
Afterwards, MPF will pulse `c_coil1` which should then activate `s_test1`.
In turn the hardware rule should pulse `c_coil2` which then activates
`s_test2`.
Hardware benchmark will measure the timings of the two switches.
It will repeat this procedure a few times and run some statistics on the
results.
