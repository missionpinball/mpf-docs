Service Command Line
====================

The MPF service cli is a fast way to debug or troubleshoot your machine during
development and operation.

1. Start your game (e.g. using ``mpf both``)
2. Start the service cli from within your game folder using ``mpf service``.

Your game will go into service mode and you can run diagnostics commands.
Once you are done the game will continue and exit service mode.
You can use tab to complete commands and arguments.
