Wizard Modes
============

Unlockable game modes that take over the playfield are typically referred to as
"wizard" modes and are often considered milestones for a player's progress. Here
we will outline some common approaches to tracking, starting, and completing wizard
modes in MPF.

Achievements to Qualify Wizard Modes
------------------------------------

The simplest way to track a player qualifying, attempting, and completing wizard modes
is through :doc:`achievements </config/achievements>`, a special type of player variable
that progress through a series of pre-defined states. 

One common approach for wizard modes is to have a counter that tracks shots to qualify the mode. In this example, hitting three shots will enable and immediately start the wizard mode:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  ##! mode: wizard_qualify
  # mode: wizard_qualify
  mode:
    start_events: mode_base_started
  achievements:
    winterhascome:
      enable_events: logicblock_winteriscoming_count_complete
      start_events: achievement_winterhascome_state_enabled

  counters:
    winteriscoming_count:
      starting_count: 0
      count_complete_value: 3
      count_events: winteriscoming_shot_hit

  ##! mode: winterhascome
  # mode: winterhascome
  mode:
    start_events: achievement_winterhascome_state_started

  ##! test
  #! start_game
  #! post mode_base_started
  #! post winteriscoming_shot_hit
  #! post winteriscoming_shot_hit
  #! assert_mode_not_running winterhascome
  #! post winteriscoming_shot_hit
  #! assert_mode_running winterhascome

The different achievement states allow you to fine-tune when and how modes can be qualified. Achievements can be *enabled/disabled*, *selected*, *started/stopped*, and *completed*, and have some rules to help control the flow:

* *disabled* achievements must be enabled before any other state changes will work
* *enabled* achievements can be disabled, selected, or started
* *selected* achievements can be disabled, started, or completed
* *started* achievements can be stopped or completed
* *completed* achievements cannot change state anymore

By combining these state flows with your qualifying shots, mode selections, and end-of-ball events, there is a lot of flexibility for using achievements to track wizard modes. For example, a one-time-only wizard mode could distinguish between an *enabled* achievement (i.e. it hasn't been played) and a *stopped* achievement (i.e. it has been played), while a wizard mode awarding a bonus for accomplishing some goal could distinguish between a *stopped* achievement and a *completed* achievement.

Of course, there's no requirement that achievements be used to start and stop wizard modes. Achievements are a convenience for tracking progress, your own game design may have other approaches.

Starting and Stopping Wizard Modes
----------------------------------

Most wizard modes will be started and stopped like any other game mode, using the mode `start_events` and `stop_events`. There will usually be a close relationship between the start/stop events and the achievement state events, as in these typical examples:

::

  # Use a counter to enable an achievement
  achievements:
    captainschair:
      enable_events: completed_missions_count_hit{value==6}

  # Enable an achievement to start a mode [direct event]
  mode:
    start_events: achievement_captainschair_state_enabled

  # Enable an achievement to start a mode [indirect event]
  event_player:
    achievement_captainschair_state_enabled: start_mode_captainschair

  # Start an achievement when its wizard mode starts
  achievements:
    captainschair:
      start_events: mode_captainschair_started

  # Complete an objective to complete an achievement [direct event]
  achievements:
    captainschair:
      complete_events: logicblock_captainshots_counter_complete
  
  # Complete an objective to complete an achievement [indirect event]
  achievements:
    captainschair:
      complete_events: captainschair_complete
  event_player:
    logicblock_captainshots_counter_complete: captainschair_complete

  # Stop an achievement when a mode stops
  achievements:
    captainschair:
      stop_events: mode_captainschair_will_stop

For wizard modes that stop other game modes, disable qualifier shots or ball locks, and/or have other "takeover" behaviors, consider using :doc:`Mode Layering <mode_layering>` to handle the transitions in and out of wizard modes.

After a Wizard Mode
-------------------

Most wizard modes are only played once and have a "completion" goal for the player to accomplish. Mid-game wizard modes (also called "mini-wizard" modes) will usually end if the goal is completed, while end-of-game wizard modes play until the ball drains. Similarly, end-of-game wizard modes typically restart immediately on the players next ball while mid-game wizard modes usually do not. Multiball wizard modes usually remain active until only one ball is left in play.

Achievement states are an excellent way to track how a wizard mode ended and whether it impacts future game behavior. If you're using the *achievement_(name)_started* event to start your wizard mode the ``restart_after_stop_possible:`` setting determines whether a "stopped" achievement can be started and the ``restart_on_next_ball_when_started:`` setting will post the *achievement_(name)_started* event when its parent mode starts. If the wizard mode has a "completion" goal, the achievement's "completed" state can be used to track whether a player accomplished it.
