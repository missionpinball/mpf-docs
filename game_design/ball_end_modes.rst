Ball End Modes
==============

Certain modes typically run on game end.
MPF has a lot of built-in modes for this purpose.
You can omit any of them or replace them with your own mode.

Ball end modes delay the ball ending process.
If you want your own mode to delay the ball ending process you can start the
with the following config:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    ##! mode: custom_bonus
    #config_version=5

    mode:
      start_events: ball_ending     # start on ball ending process
      use_wait_queue: true          # delay ball ending
      priority: 500                 # determines the order of ball end modes
      stop_events: stop_my_mode     # post this event to stop the mode and continue the ball ending process

Ball ending will be delayed until your mode stops so make sure that your mode
ends eventually or the game will be stuck.
In the example above your config need to post ``stop_my_mode`` or, if you are
writing code, stop your mode in code.
