=======================================

This section assumes that you already configured all your hardware devices
(especially all your :doc:`ball device </config/ball_devices>`).
If you did not configure your hardware please do that first.
You can go through the :doc:`tutorial </tutorial/index>` or have a look a the :doc:`mechs section </mechs/index>`.
