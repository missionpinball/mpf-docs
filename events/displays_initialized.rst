displays_initialized
====================

*MPF Event*

Posted as soon as MPF MC displays have been initialized.

Note that this event is used as part of the internal MPF-MC startup
process. In some cases it will be posted *before* the slide_player is
ready, meaning that you *CANNOT* use this event to post slides or play
sounds.

Instead, use the *mc_ready* event, which is posted as early as possible
once the slide player and sound players are setup.

Note that this event is generated by the media controller and does not
exist on the MPF side of things.

Also note that if you're using a media controller other than the MPF-MC
(such as the Unity 3D backbox controller), then this event won't exist.
