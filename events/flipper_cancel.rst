flipper_cancel
==============

*MPF Event*

Posted when both flipper buttons are hit at the same time,
useful as a "cancel" event for shows, the bonus mode, etc.

Note that in order for this event to work, you have to add
``left_flipper`` as a tag to the switch for your left flipper,
and ``right_flipper`` to your right flipper.

See :doc:`/config/combo_switches` for details.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
