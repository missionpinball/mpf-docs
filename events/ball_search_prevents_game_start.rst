ball_search_prevents_game_start
===============================

*MPF Event*

A game start has been requested, but the ball search process
is running and thus the game start has been blocked. This is a
good event to use for a slide player to inform the player that the
machine is looking for a missing ball.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
