extra_ball_group_(name)_lit_awarded
===================================

*MPF Event*

This even is posted when an extra ball is lit during play.
It is NOT posted when a player's turn starts if they have a lit
extra ball from their previous turn. Therefore this event is a
good event to use for your award slides and shows when a player
lights the extra ball, because you don't want to use
:doc:`extra_ball_group_name_lit` because that is also posted when
the player's turn starts and you don't want the award show to play
again when they're starting their turn.

*This event does not have any keyword arguments*
