Handler Priorities
==================

When you have some code you want to register to be a handler for an event, you
can optionally specify a priority. (Priority is just an integer value.) The
default priority for events is 1. If you want a guarantee that a certain event
handler will fire last, then register that handler with a priority that's lower
than any other handler for that event. And if you want to guarantee that a
handler fires first, register it with a higher priority. (In this case, "higher"
and "lower" are literal. A handler with a priority of 500 will be called before
a handler of 100.)

The actual integer values of the priorities are arbitrary. They're called
one-by-one, one after the other, in order from highest to lowest. Whether your
priorities are 3, 2, and 1, or 1000, 100 and 0, or 1000, 999, 998, and 1 makes
no difference.

MPF automatically registers event handlers from modes with the priority of that
mode, meaning high-priority modes get access to an event before lower-priority
modes. (This is useful since it gives higher-priority modes a chance to "block"
events from lower-priority modes.)

See :doc:`/config/instructions/device_control_events` on how to use event
handlers in devices.
