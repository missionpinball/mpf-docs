Coil player
===========

The *coil player* is a :doc:`config player </config_players/index>` that's used pulse, enable, or disable
coils and drivers.

This is an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   coil_player:
      some_event: coil_1
      some_other_event:
         coil_2:
            action: enable
            hold_power: .5

In the example above, when the event called ``some_event`` is posted, coil_1 will pulse.
When the event ``some_other_event`` is posted, coil_2 will enable (be held on) at power
level 4.

Note that the ``some_event: coil_1`` is entered in a different way than the ``some_other_event:``.
The first one has a simple key/value pair, whereas the second has a complete nested sub-configuration.

The first example shows the "express" config, while the second shows the
full config. (What's an "express config?" Details :doc:`here </config/instructions/express_config>`.

The coil player's express config is the "pulse" action.

Example coil player from a show:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: test
   - time: 0
     coils:
       coil1: pulse
