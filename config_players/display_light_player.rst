Using LEDs as display (display_light_player)
============================================

You can map any display to your playfield LEDs or any LEDs (e.g. a LED matrix)
in your machine. This enables you to leverage any MC features and display
them on any LEDs (or more specifically any lights) in your machine.


To use this in a show you can use this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: test_show
   - display_lights:
       your_source_display:     # use any display defined in your machine
         lights: "*"            # map all lights. you can also use a tag

Or standalone:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   display_light_player:
     your_event:
       your_source_display:
         lights: "*"


Then map your lights to a position on the display:


.. code-block:: mpf-config

   lights:
     l_light1:
       number: 1
       x: 0.3595817467355206
       y: 0.026751757949132805
     l_light2:
       number: 2
       x: 0.34303657433971446
       y: 0.02873336964906857


You can map those in the MPF monitor and then copy the locations using the
script in ``tools/monitor_to_config.py`` or manually. You may need to adjust
config names in the script (improvements welcome).
