Sound player
============

The *sound player* is a :doc:`config player </config_players/index>` that's used to control
sounds. (This player is part of the MPF media controller and only available if you're using MPF-MC
for your media controller.)

See :doc:`/sound/index` and :doc:`/sound/basic_setup` for details.

will trigger sound actions are nested sub-headings and sound names are either listed as nested
sub-headings below that.

Usage in shows

In shows, the sound player is used via the ``sounds:`` section of a step.

Optional settings

Additional information may be found in the :doc:`sound_player </config/sound_player>`
