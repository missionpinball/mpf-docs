Sound Loop player
=================

The *sound loop player* is a :doc:`config player </config_players/index>` that's used to control
sound loop sets (used by sound loop audio tracks). (This player is part of the MPF media controller
and only available if you're using MPF-MC for your media controller.)

Examples:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   sound_loop_player:
     play_basic_beat:
       loops:
         action: play
         sound_loop_set: basic_beat
         timing: loop_end
     add_hi_hats:
       loops:
         action: play_layer
         layer: 1
         timing: loop_end
     stop_hi_hats:
       loops:
         action: stop_looping_layer
         layer: 1
     add_snare:
       loops:
         action: play_layer
         fade_in: 2s
         layer: 2
         timing: now
     add_claps:
       loops:
         action: play_layer
         layer: 3
         timing: loop_end

Basic usage:

.. code-block:: yaml

   sound_loop_player:
     <triggering_event_name>:
       <sound_loop track name>:
         action: <action name>
         <optional settings>
     <triggering_event_name>:
       <sound_loop track name>:
         action: <action name>
         <optional settings>


Usage in config files
---------------------

In config files, the sound player is used via the ``sound_loop_player:`` section.  Event names
that will trigger sound actions are nested sub-headings and sound_loop_set names are either listed
as nested sub-headings below that.

Usage in shows
--------------

In shows, the sound player is used via the ``sounds_loop_sets:`` section of a step.

Optional settings
-----------------

Additional information may be found in the :doc:`sound_loop_player </config/sound_loop_player>`
configuration reference documentation.
