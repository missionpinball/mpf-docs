Widget player
=============

The *widget player* is a :doc:`config player </config_players/index>` that's used to add or remove widgets to existing
slides on a display. (This player is part of the MPF media controller and only available if you're using MPF-MC for your
media controller.)

Note that the widget player is a :doc:`config_player </config_players/index>`, so everything
mentioned below is valid in the ``widget_player:`` section of a config file *and* in the ``widgets:``
section of a :doc:`show step </shows/content>`.

Full instructions on how to use the slide_player are included in the
:doc:`/displays/widgets/index` section of the documentation. The stuff here
in the config reference is for reference later.
You can test slides and widgets interactively using
:doc:`Interactive MC (iMC) </tools/imc/index>`.

Generically-speaking, there are two formats you can use for widget_player
entries: "express" and "full" configs. Express configs will look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   widget_player:
      event1: widget1
      event2: widget2
      event3: widget3

Full configs will look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   widget_player:
      event1:
         widget1:
            <settings>
      event2:
         widget2:
            <settings>
      event3:
         widget3:
            <settings>

In both cases, these configurations are saying, "When *event1* is posted,
add widget *widget1*. When *event2* is posted, add *widget2*. Etc."

This "express" config is down-and-dirty, with no options, to just add widgets to
the current slide on the default display.
The full config lets you specify additional options (based on the settings
detailed below).

For example, the following config will add *widget_1* when *some_event* is posted, but it
will also override the default settings and add widget to the slide called *slide_2*, even
if that's not the current slide that's showing.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   widget_player:
      some_event:
         widget_1:
            slide: slide_2
