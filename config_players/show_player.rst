Show player
===========

The *show player* is a :doc:`config player </config_players/index>` that's used to start, stop, pause, resume, advance,
and/or update shows.

This is an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   show_player:
      some_event: your_show_name
      some_other_event: another_show

In the example above, when the event *some_event* is posted, the show called ``your_show_name`` will be played (started).
When the event *some_other_event* is posted, the show called ``another_show`` will be played.

Notice that the config above has simple key/value pairs in the form of *event: show*. You can list as many of those as
you want in the show player, and when each event is posted, it will start the show with the same name.

However there are times when you might want to specify additional options for a show. Perhaps you want to change the
playback speed, or configure how it repeats. In that case, instead of putting the show name on the same line as the
event, you can put the show name on a new line under the event, and then add additional settings under it, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   show_player:
      some_event:
         your_show_name:
            loops: 0
      some_other_event:
         another_show:
            speed: 2
            sync_ms: 500

In the example above, the show ``your_show_name`` will play when the event *some_event* is posted, but instead of playing
with the default settings only, it will also play with the setting ``loops: 0`` (meaning it will not loop and just play
once). Same for the other show above, which will play with a ``speed: 2`` and ``sync_ms: 500``.

You can also mix-and-match formats, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   show_player:
      some_event: your_show_name
      some_other_event:
         another_show:
            speed: 2
            sync_ms: 500

Show keys
---------

Each show played by a show player will be referenced internally using an unique ``key``.
The show_player will use the show name as key for the show by default if you do not specify a ``key`` (fine in most cases).
This way it refences the show when starting or stopping it:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   show_player:
      start_my_show:
         your_show_name: play
      stop_my_show:
         your_show_name: stop

In this example the event ``start_my_show`` will start ``your_show_name`` with key ``your_show_name``.
The event ``stop_my_show`` will then stop the same show using the key ``your_show_name``.
This simple mechanism will work fine for most cases.

However, in some cases you want to play multiple instances of one show in a single show.
You can manually assign keys to run distinct shows.
That way you can also specifically stop them later:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   show_player:
      start_my_show1:
         your_show_name:
           action: play
           key: show1
           show_tokens:
             leds: my_led1
      start_my_show2:
         your_show_name:
           action: play
           key: show2
           show_tokens:
             leds: my_led2
      stop_my_show1:
         show1: stop
      stop_my_show2:
         show2: stop


In this example ``start_my_show1`` and ``start_my_show2`` will start separate
instances of ``your_show_name`` which can indendently be stopped using
``stop_my_show1`` and ``stop_my_show2``.
If you omit ``key`` in this example ``start_my_show1`` and ``start_my_show2``
would stop the other and you would either see ``your_show_name`` with
``my_led1`` or ``my_led2`` but not both at the same time.

A key is only unique to one show_player so different modes will not interfere.

Usage in config files
---------------------

In config files, the show player is used via the ``show_player:`` section.

Usage in shows
--------------

In shows, the show player is used via the ``shows:`` section of a step. (Yes, you can include shows in shows, meaning
you can essentially use a parent show like a playlist, or as a controller that starts and stops other shows.)

Config Options
--------------

See :doc:`/config/show_player` for config details.
