Slide player
============

The *slide player* is a :doc:`config player </config_players/index>` in the MPF
media controller that is used to play slide content, including showing slides,
hiding slides, and removing slides. (This player is part of the MPF media controller
and only available if you're using MPF-MC for your media controller.)

Note that the slide player is a :doc:`config_player </config_players/index>`, so everything
mentioned below is valid in the ``slide_player:`` section of a config file *and* in the ``slides:``
section of a show step. You can test slides and widgets interactively using
:doc:`Interactive MC (iMC) </tools/imc/index>`.

Full instructions on how to use the slide_player are included in the
:doc:`/displays/slides/showing_slides` guide. The documentation here is for
reference later.

Generically-speaking, there are two formats you can use for slide_player
entries: "express" and "full" configs. Express configs will look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slide_player:
      event1: slide1
      event2: slide2
      event3: slide3

Full configs will look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   slide_player:
      event1:
         slide1:
            <settings>
      event2:
         slide2:
            <settings>
      event3:
         slide3:
            <settings>

In both cases, these configurations are saying, "When *event1* is posted,
show *slide1*. When *event2* is posted, show *slide2*. Etc."

This "express" config is down-and-dirty, with no options, to just show slides.
The full config lets you specify additional options (based on the settings
detailed below).

For example, the following config will show *slide_1* when *some_event* is posted, but it
will also override the default settings and show the slide on the display target called
*display1* and at a priority that's 200 higher than the base priority.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slide_player:
      some_event:
         slide_1:
            target: display1
            priority: 200

Showing dynamically-created slides
----------------------------------

Both of the examples so far assumed that you were using the slide player to show a slide
that had already been defined in the :doc:`/config/slides` section if your config.
However you can also define slides right in-line in your slide player.

The following config will show a slide called *slide_1* when the *some_event* is posted,
but it assumes that *slide_1* does not yet exist, and it contains a list of widgets (one
text widget and one rectangle widget) which will be added to that slide.

Note that slide names are global in MPF, so if you already had a slide defined called
*slide_1* and you redefine it in your slide player like the example below, this new slide
will become *slide_1* and the old one will be gone.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slide_player:
      some_event:
         slide_1:
            widgets:
            - type: text
              text: I AM A TEXT WIDGET
            - type: rectangle
              width: 200
              height: 100
              color: red

You can also mix-and-match defining a slide in the slide player as well as adjusting
properties of how the slide is shown. Just add multiple settings, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   slide_player:
      some_event:
         slide_1:
            target: display2
            widgets:
            - type: text
              text: I AM A TEXT WIDGET
            - type: rectangle
              width: 200
              height: 100
              color: red
            transition: wipe

Remember that these slide player settings can also be used in show steps (in a ``slides:``
section). Any of the examples above apply, you just don't include the event name, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: show1
   #show_version=5

   - time: 0
     slides: slide1
   - time: +3
     slides: slide2
   - time: +3
     slides:
       slide3:          # newly-defined slide here
         widgets:
           - type: text
             text: I AM SLIDE 3 IN THIS SHOW
             color: lime
   - time: +3
     slides:
       slide4:
         transition:
           type: move_out
           duration: 1s
           direction: up

Here's a list of all the valid settings for individual slides in the ``slide_player:``
section of your config file or the ``slides:`` section of a show. Note that all of these
are optional. Any that you do not include will be automatically added with the default
values applied.


Usage in config files
---------------------

In config files, the slide player is used via the ``slide_player:`` section.

Usage in shows
--------------

In shows, the slide player is used via the ``slides:`` section of a step.

List of settings and options
----------------------------

Refer to the :doc:`slide_player </config/slide_player>` section of
the config file reference for a full explanation of how to use the
slide player in both config and show files.

Config Options
--------------

See :doc:`/config/slide_player` for config details.
