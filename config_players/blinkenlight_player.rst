Blinkenlight player
===================

The *blinkenlight player* is a :doc:`config player </config_players/index>` that's used add or remove
colors from a blinkenlight.

.. note:: **What is a blinkenlight?**

   A blinkenlight is a flashing light on your pinball machine.  But it's different than
   a normal flashing light that you might have in a show, because with a blinkenlight,
   multiple modes (or shows) can add colors to the light, and the blinkenlight will
   flash all the colors in a sequence.

   Blinkenlights are useful if you have a game where multiple modes could be running
   and they all share the same shot(s).  Each mode could have a different color,
   and the light for the shot could flash between all the colors, to show the player
   that shooting that shot will score all those modes at once.
   
   For example, this is the kind of thing that happens in Stern's Game of
   Thrones.  If you start multiple houses at the same time, and they share shot(s)
   the sigils in front of those shots will flash different colors to show you
   that the same shot will score different modes. The left ramp might alternate
   between white (Stark) and red (Lannister) to show you that both modes will
   score that shot.

This is an example of a blinkenlight player:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    blinkenlight_player:
      some_event:
        my_blinkenlight: red
      some_other_event:
        my_blinkenlight:
          action: add
          key: blue_color
          color: blue

In the example above, when the event called ``some_event`` is posted, the color
red will be added to the blinkenlight ``my_blinkenlight``.
When the event ``some_other_event`` is posted, the color blue will be added to the
same blinkenlight.  This color has the key ``blue_color``, which is useful if we
want to remove the color later.

Note that the ``some_event`` example has a shortened config than the ``some_other_event``
example.  This shortened version is called an express config.  The blinkenlight's
express config is the same thing as doing an "add" action with the color you
specify.  It's just a shorter way to do the same thing.  You can read more about
express configs :doc:`here </config/instructions/express_config>`.  Also, see the section
below called Express Config for more information on the express config.

To use a blinkenlight player, you first have to define a blinkenlight within your
machine config (see the blinkenlight page :doc:`here </config/blinkenlights>`).  The blinkenlight's config will set which actual light in your pinball
machine is controlled by the blinkenlight. When you add a color to the blinkenlight
from a blinkenlight player, the light will start to flash that color.  As more
colors are added, the light will cycle through all the colors.

.. note:: It makes the most sense to specify an RGB LED as the underlying light for a blinkenlight,
   since the whole idea is for the light to flash different colors.  There's nothing
   that stops you from adding a regular light, though.  Instead of colors, you could specify
   different brightness levels to flash.  Either way, we refer to those as "colors"
   in this documentation. 

A Blinkenlight's cycle
----------------------

The blinkenlight will cycle through all the colors that have been added to it.
You have control over how this cycle works.  All of the options to control a
blinkenlight's cycle are controlled from the ``blinkenlights`` section of your
config file, and not the ``blinkenlight_player`` section.

For example, you can specify how
long each color is displayed by setting the ``color_duration`` property of the
blinkenlight.  This will cause each color to be displayed for a specified length
of time, and the more colors you add, the longer the blinkenlight's cycle will take.
Alternatively, if you want the blinkenlight's cycle to last a certain amount of time
regardless of how many colors are added to it, you can set the ``cycle_duration``
instead.

When the blinkenlight only has one color, it will flash that single color in a
sequence like this: ``on`` ``off`` ``on`` ``off`` and so on.  When more than one
color is added, however, you might not want the light to turn off at the end of
each cycle.  For example, if your blinkenlight has two colors, red and green,
you might want the cycle to be: ``red`` ``green`` ``off`` ``red`` ``green`` ``off``,
or you might simply want it to be ``red`` ``green`` ``red`` ``green``.  You can
control this behavior with the ``off_when_multiple`` setting of your blinkenlight.
Setting this value to ``True`` will turn the light off at the end of each cycle.
The default value is ``False``, which will not turn the light off when multiple
colors are present.

Blinkenlights will stay in sync with each other automatically, if you have multiple
blinkenlights with the same settings and the same number of colors.  So, for example,
if you have two blinkenlights with the same ``cycle_duration``, and each one has
3 colors added to it, then they will
start their cycles at the same time, and end their cycles at the same time.  This
way, the blinkenlights will stay in sync with each other.  This is useful if you
have a blinkenlight on your left and right ramps, for example, and you want them
both to flash the same colors.  You would want them to show the same colors at the
same time.

A cycle example
---------------

Let's say you have a blinkenlight that is set up like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    #! lights:
    #!   l_left_ramp_arrow:
    #!     channels:
    #!       red:
    #!         number: 1
    #!       green:
    #!         number: 2
    #!       blue:
    #!         number: 3
    #!   l_right_ramp_arrow:
    #!     channels:
    #!       red:
    #!         number: 4
    #!       green:
    #!         number: 5
    #!       blue:
    #!         number: 6
    blinkenlights:
      blinkenlight_1:
        cycle_duration: 1s
        off_when_multiple: false
        light: l_left_ramp_arrow
   
In this case, ``blinkenlight_1`` has a ``cycle_duration`` value of ``1s``. That is, each
cycle lasts 1 second, regardless of how many colors the blinkenlight has. Now, let's
say you use a blinkenlight_player to add the color red to the blinkenlight.
Now the blinkenlight's cycle would look like this:

+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  red  |  off  |  red  |  off  |  red  |  off  |  red  |  off  |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

If green color is added to the blinkenlight, the cycle would change to this:

+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  red  | green |  red  | green |  red  | green |  red  | green |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

Now let's say a third color (blue) is added:

+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      |
+----+-----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+----+
|  r |  g  |  b |  r |  g  |  b |  r |  g  |  b |  r |  g  |  b |
+----+-----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+----+----+-----+----+

Note that each color now is only 1/3 of a second long, since there are three of them per cycle now.

Now, blue is removed from the blinkenlight, while the blinkenlight is currently showing a blue color during the second cycle:

+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      | 1 second      |
+----+-----+----+----+-----+--+-+-------+-------+-------+-------+
|  r |  g  |  b |  r |  g  | b|g|  red  | green |  red  | green |
+----+-----+----+----+-----+--+-+-------+-------+-------+-------+

Notice how blue is displayed when the color is removed, and the light immediately
switches to green, since green should be displayed at that point in time now that
the blinkenlight only has 2 colors. So the end result is green "flashes" very
briefly before red is displayed again and the red/green cycle starts.

Using Blinkenlights in shows
----------------------------

You can also use blinkenlight_player from within a show.  This lets you add
colors to a blinkenlight during a show.  It probably doesn't make sense most of
the time to do this, because colors you add to a blinkenlight will only stick
around while the show is active.  Once the show ends, the colors you added during
that show will automatically be removed from the blinkenlight.

.. note:: This is true of colors added during modes as well.  If a mode in your
   game adds colors to a blinkenlight, those colors will be automatically removed
   from the blinkenlight when the mode ends.  If you restart the mode, those colors
   won't come back automatically, however, so keep that in mind.  You might need
   to add the colors again when the mode restarts, depending on how your game works.

Example blinkenlight player from a show:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: test
   - time: 0
     blinkenlights:
       my_blinkenlight: red

Usage in config files
---------------------

In config files, the blinkenlight player is used via the ``blinkenlight_player:`` section.

Usage in shows
--------------

In shows, the blinkenlight player is used via the ``blinkenlights:`` section of a step.

Express Config and Keyless Colors
---------------------------------

As mentioned above, the express config for ``blinkenlight_player`` performs the ``add`` action. So,
the color you specify as the express config value will be the color to add to
the blinkenlight.  However, if you add a color this way, there is no ``key`` value for the
color.  Or, more specifically, the ``key`` value will be empty.  We could refer
to colors without a ``key`` value as a keyless color. If you later use the ``remove`` action and don't specify
a ``key`` to remove, then the keyless color will be removed.

This is better explained with an example.  Consider this ``blinkenlight_player``:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    blinkenlight_player:
      some_event:
        my_blinkenlight: red
      some_other_event:
        my_blinkenlight:
          action: remove

In this case, the color ``red`` will be added to ``my_blinkenlight`` when the
``some_event`` event is posted.  This color doesn't have a ``key`` value, so this
color is keyless.  When
the ``some_other_event`` event is posted, the ``remove``
action is performed.  Since this ``remove`` action also didn't specify a ``key`` value, then
MPF will look for a keyless color and remove that color from the blinkenlight.
In this case, the color red will be removed.

Note that keyless colors are only valid within the context of the mode or show
that is performing the keyless action.  So, a ``remove`` action from ``mode1`` will
not remove the keyless color that was added by ``mode2``.  It will only remove the 
keyless color added by ``mode1``.

There's a special value you can use in the express config to remove a keyless
color.  Instead of using the full config and specifying an ``action: remove`` as
we did above, you can use the special color ``stop`` or ``remove`` in the express
config to do the same thing.  The following is equivalent to the example above:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    blinkenlight_player:
      some_event:
        my_blinkenlight: red
      some_other_event:
        my_blinkenlight: remove

In this case, the red color is added to the blinkenlight when ``some_event`` is
posted, and then removed when ``some_other_event`` is posted.
