Tutorial step 17: Add lights (or LEDs)
======================================

Now that you're able to run a complete (albeit boring) game, let's get
your lights or LEDs configured and make it so they play a show while
your machine is in attract mode.

If you're following this tutorial with virtual hardware, it's still
worth doing this step because use can use :doc:`/tools/monitor/index` to
see your lights and LEDs in realtime against a picture of your playfield.

1. Understand "lights"
----------------------

In MPF, "lights" refers to bulbs that are plugged into a lamp matrix,
or to direct-connected LEDs (which are usually RGB). So lights might be
either LEDs or lamps in a matrix.
See :doc:`/mechs/lights/lights_versus_leds` for details.

2. Add your lights/LEDs to your machine config file
---------------------------------------------------

Once you figure out whether you have lights or LEDs, you need to add the
relevant section to your machine configuration file. There's probably
not much to explain here. Adding lights is pretty similar to adding
switches and coils.

See the relevant documentation for each for instructions how
to enter them:

* :doc:`/mechs/lights/index`

3: Create an attract mode light/LED show
----------------------------------------

Once you add your lights, you need a simple way to test them
to make sure they're working. We typically throw together a quick
attract mode light show so we can see some blinking lights as soon as
MPF boots up.

The easiest way to create a complex series of light actions is with
MPF's *show* functionality. This is the exact same type of show that
we use for the display loop, except this time we configure lights
for each step instead of slides.

So the first thing to do is to create another show file in your attract mode
shows folders. Let's call this one ``attract_light_show.yaml``. Your
attract mode shows should now look like this:

.. image:: images/attract_folder_with_light_show.png

Note that we started both of these file names with the word "attract".
That is certainly not required and you can name them whatever you want.
We find it's a bit easier to add the mode name so we can know which
files are which when we have a bunch of files open in the editor at the
same time.

4. Add some entries to your show
--------------------------------

There are all sorts of things you can do with a light show file that
you'll become familiar with as you get deeper into your game
configuration. For now we're just going to create a simple show that
cycles through three lights. We'll call them *light1*, *light2*, and
*light3*, though there's a good chance that you don't have lights with
those names in your machine so you'll have to change them to names
that actually exist for you. If you have matrix lights, add entries to
your ``attract_light_show.yaml`` file so that it looks something like
like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    ##! show: attract_light_show
    #show_version=5
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_light2: 0
        l_light1: ff
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_light1: 0
        l_light2: ff
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_light2: 0
        l_light3: ff
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_light3: 0
        l_light2: ff

Matrix lights don't have color setting since their color is determined
by the color of the bulb and/or the color of the insert. So the ``0``
and ``ff`` values here just represent "off" (0) and "on" (255). If you
look at the four steps in this show, you'll see the first step turns
off *l_light2* and turns on *l_light1*, the next one turns *l_light2*
and turns off *l_light1*, etc. In other words, if this show runs in a
loop you'll get a never ending 1-2-3-2-1-2-3-2-1-2-3-2... pattern. If
you have RGB LEDs, then you can have some more fun and actually specify
different colors for each light at each step. For example, if you just
wanted to have a show that cycled three RGB LEDs through the colors of
the rainbow, you could create a show like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    ##! show: attract_light_show
    #show_version=5
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_led1: red
        l_led2: red
        l_led3: ff0000
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_led1: ff6600
        l_led2: ff6600
        l_led3: ff6600
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_led1: ffcc00
        l_led2: ffcc00
        l_led3: ffcc00
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_led1: lime
        l_led2: 00ff00
        l_led3: 00ff00
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_led1: blue
        l_led2: 0000ff
        l_led3: 0000ff
    - duration: 1
      lights:
        l_led1: ff00aa
        l_led2: ff00aa
        l_led3: ff00aa

Obviously this is just the very beginning of what you can do. You can
create shows that are hundreds of steps involving dozens of lights.
(Notice that if you don't specify a change for a particular light for
a step then that light just stays at whatever it was before. In other
words, you only have to enter the new values for the lights that
change each step-â€”you don't have to enter all the lights from scratch
every step.)

Again, notice that for the color of the LEDs, you can specify a color either
in the form of a string name or a 6-digit hex color codes. If you go with
names, you can use `any of these colors <http://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/>`_.

5. Configure your show to play
------------------------------

This new show file is just like your existing display show, except this
one contains settings for lights. So to get it to play, add it to
the ``show_player:`` section of your attract mode config file, set to play
on the *mode_attract_started* event just like the display show.

The only catch here is that the YAML file cannot have the same setting entered
twice. (If you did this, the second one would overwrite the first one which
would be really confusing. In fact if MPF sees that, MPF will exit and print
a warning about the duplicate so you can fix it.)

MPF offers a way around this though, in that you can add a ``.1`` to the end
of the event name, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: test_mode
   #config_version=5
   show_player:
     mode_attract_started: attract_display_loop
     mode_attract_started.1: attract_light_show

Adding the ``.1`` doesn't really affect anything in terms of how this works,
it just makes it so this is valid YAML and both entries get set. (And you can
have more than one, ``.2``, etc. In fact you can have any number, they don't have
to be in order or anything.

You also might be wondering why we don't just make a single attract show and
put the slides and lights in the same show?

Certainly that's possible, but we like to keep things separate, as this will
let you start and stop them on their own, and it will make it easier to
tweak things (like the playback speed) of one thing without breaking other
things.

Save your files, and run your game. You should see your light show and the display
show start playing once the attract mode starts up.

If you're using the virtual interface without a real pinball machine, this is
probably a good time to use the :doc:`MPF Monitor </tools/monitor/index>` to see that
the light show is actually working. (Expand the "light" or "LED" section in the
devices window to see your lights and watch the colors cycle.

6. Speed things up
------------------

While it's cool that the show is working, it's kind of lame because it runs so slow
with 1 second between steps. So let's speed it up.

You could go into your show and adjust the ``duration:`` of each step, but that's
kind of a pain since you have to change every single step, and it makes it
annoying when you're playing with different values.

Instead, we like to tweak the playback speed of the show which is something we can
do in the ``show_player:`` entry. (In fact, we almost always use the duration values
in shows as a sort of "relative" duration of one step to another, and then set the
actual speed at play time.

So if we want each step to be 1/4th of a second, we need to play the show at 4x the
speed. Simple, just add a ``speed: 4`` to the show_player entry.

.. code-block:: yaml

   #config_version=5
   show_player:
     mode_attract_started: attract_display_loop
     mode_attract_started.1: attract_light_show
       speed: 4

   # don't try this, it won't work

If you try to run MPF with the config above, MPF will halt with the following error
(scroll to the right to see it all):

.. code-block:: python

   ValueError: YAML error found in file /mpf-examples/tutorial_step_17/modes/attract/config/attract.yaml. Line 6, Position 10

What gives?

The problem is that entries in YAML files can be *either* setting names and values *or* section names with subsections,
but not both. So in the example above, it sees ``mode_attract_started.1: attract_light_show`` as a setting name and
value, but then it also sees ``speed: 4`` indented under it. The YAML processor doesn't know what to do?

To fix this, we need to make a slight change to our YAML file, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: test_mode
   #config_version=5
   show_player:
     mode_attract_started: attract_display_loop
     mode_attract_started.1:
       attract_light_show:
         speed: 4

What we've done is moved the show name (``attract_light_show``) under the event name (``mode_attract_started.1``), and
then we added the speed setting under there.

If you wanted to, you could consolidate the duplicate ``mode_attract_started`` entries like so:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: test_mode
   #config_version=5
   show_player:
     mode_attract_started:
       attract_display_loop:
         speed: 1
       attract_light_show:
         speed: 4

Either option is fine, and you'll probably end up with both techniques scattered throughout your configs.

7. Configure more light shows to all run at once
------------------------------------------------

The simple light show with two or three lights is a good first
step, but it's hardly what could be considered a "real" attract mode
light show. Unfortunately if you look at a real pinball machine, you
might be overwhelmed by all the crazy light action. But if you really
look closely, you'll realize that the super-complex looking light
shows on real pinball machines are just lots of little shows all
running at the same time.

For example, look at how we can break down the attract mode light show
of *Demolition Man*: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h_rhHExmX4

So if we were creating the
attract mode light show like this for MPF, we would actually create
lots of little shows each with just a few lights in them. Then we'd
end up with a list of show files, like this:

+ flipper_red_flashing.yaml
+ purple_mode_sweep.yaml
+ inlane_alternating.yaml
+ random_flashing.yaml
+ car_chase_sweep.yaml
+ ramp_orbit_sweep.yaml
+ right_orbit_sweep.yaml
+ claw_sweep.yaml
+ mtl_sweep.yaml
+ center_ramp_sweep.yaml
+ standups_sweep.yaml

Again, we'd make every step of every show have a duration of 1. Then in our
``show_player:`` configuration, we'd configure the list of shows to
play when the attract mode starts instead of just one. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    show_player:
        mode_attract_started:
          attract_display_loop:
            speed: 1
          flipper_red_flashing:
            speed: 2
          purple_mode_sweep:
            speed: 4
          inlane_alternating:
            speed: 3
          random_flashing:
            speed: 2
          car_chase_sweep:
            speed: 3
          ramp_orbit_sweep:
            speed: 5
    ...(truncated. you get the idea)

(If you were really duplicating the *Demolition Man* attract mode light show, you'd
also want to implement a play list which plays sets of shows in timed sequences since
the real machine does one thing with the lights for a few seconds, then another, etc.

Check out the complete config.yaml file so far
----------------------------------------------

If you want to see a complete ``config.yaml`` file up to this point, it's in the ``mpf-examples/tutorial_step_17``
folder with the name ``config.yaml``. You can run it be switching to that folder and running ``mpf both``:

.. code-block:: doscon

   C:\mpf-examples\tutorial_step_17>mpf both
