Recipe: The Addams Family Mansion Awards
========================================

This guide shows you how to build an MPF config for *The Addams Family's*
Mansion Awards and Tour the Mansion feature. The idea is you can use this as
a guide to implement a similar feature in your machine.

.. note::

   This recipe requires MPF 0.33 or newer.

This guide uses the following concepts in MPF that you should be familiar
with:

* :doc:`/game_logic/modes/index`
* :doc:`/game_logic/achievements/index`
* :doc:`/game_logic/achievements/achievement_groups`
* :doc:`/shows/index`

This guide will also show you how to do a few tricky things, including:

* From a group of 12 achievements, ensure that the randomly selected one when
  the game starts is 1 of 2, not random from all 12.
* Have two shots that light the achievements, but one of the shots lights the
  achievements indefinitely and the other only lights them for 3 seconds.

You can find the complete runnable machine config for this recipe in the
``cookbook/TAF_mansion_awards`` folder of the
`mpf-examples repository <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples>`_
on GitHub.

What are the Mansion Awards & Tour the Mansion?
-----------------------------------------------

In The Addams Family, the Mansion Awards are the name for the 12 "goals" which
each have a light in the mansion on the playfield just above the flippers.

Tour the Mansion is a wizard mode (associated with the question mark insert
at the top of the mansion) that can be started after all 12 mansion awards have
been collected.

.. image:: images/taf_mansion.jpg

Here are the specific rules we need to implement:

**Mansion Awards**

* Lights for incomplete awards are off.
* Complete awards are on solid.
* The currently selected award's light is flashing.
* Hitting any pop bumper will change the currently selected award to another
  random from the awards that are not yet complete.
* When the game starts, either "Hit Cousin It" or "Mamushka" are selected.
* The selected award is awarded / collected when the electric chair is lit
  (yellow and red lights on the chair toy) and either the electric chair or
  swamp shot is hit. (The swamp is technically an operator setting, but we'll
  use it since that's what the default it.)
* Some of the awards start modes, and others are instant awards with a short
  show. Collecting an award immediately turns its light on solid and selects
  another random uncollected award.
* If 3 Mil is awarded, 6 Mil is spotted (automatically set to complete) as
  well, and vice-versa.  (This differs in the Gold Edition of the game, and is
  also an operator setting, but we're just going to hard code this behavior
  for this recipe.)
* The electric chair is lit for 3 seconds after the right inlane is hit.
* The electric chair is lit indefinitely after either ramp is hit.
* The electric chair is lit at the beginning of each ball
* For awards that start modes, the chair can be relit and another award
  awarded even while the prior award's mode is running.
* Accumulating 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95 bear kicks (center ramp)
  collects the currently selected award (except Tour the Mansion), even if the
  chair is not lit.
* Each award collected adds 500k to the bonus.

**Tour the Mansion**

* Once all 12 Mansion Awards have been collected, the Tour the Mansion light
  (the question mark at the top of the mansion) is selected.
* The electric chair must be lit in the same way as before, and then the shot
  must be made to the electric chair or the swamp as before.
* This starts the Tour the Mansion mode
* When Tour the Mansion completes, all the mansion awards are reset and a new
  random one is selected.
* If Tour the Mansion ends before the ball ends, no mansion award can be
  awarded until the next ball.

Step 1. The machine-wide prerequisites
--------------------------------------

Before we dig into how to handle the mansion itself, we need to create a
machine-wide config that has all the devices we'll need, including the lights
for the mansion, switches for the shots we need, the ramps, the right inlane,
and the switches, coils, and ball devices we need to glue it all together.

Here's what our machine config looks like. (Note that this is complete in terms
of what we need to make this recipe work, but if you have a real Addams Family
then you'll probably have a lot more than this in your machine config file.)

   # mode will be defined below
   ##! mode: chair_lit
   # mode will be defined below
   ##! mode: chair_lit_3s
   # mode will be defined below

Step 2. Add the achievements
----------------------------

Each mansion award will be an achievement. We decided to create a separate mode
called "mansion_awards" just so we can keep everything separate. (This isn't
required, it's just to help us keep it clear in our minds, and it's ok to have
lots and lots of modes in MPF.)

We'll configure this mode to start on the *ball_starting* event so it's
always running when a ball is in play. We won't configure a stop event which
means this mode will automatically stop when the ball ends.

Next we add an ``achievements:`` section and then subsections for our 12
mansion achievements.

You'll notice that most of them are almost identical. For
example, here's the entry for Thing Multiball:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: mansion_awards
   achievements:
      thing_multiball:
         show_tokens:
            lights: thing
         show_when_selected: flash
         show_when_completed: on
         events_when_started: award_thing_multiball  # starts thing_multiball mode
         enable_events: initialize_mansion, reset_mansion
         complete_events: award_thing_multiball
         reset_events: reset_mansion

Stepping through how we're using each setting:

``show_tokens:``
   link this achievement to it's light on the playfield.

``show_when_selected: flash``
   Plays the show called "flash" when this achievement is selected. Note that
   the default "flash" show is 1 sec on / 1 sec off. While you can play it
   faster, the original Addams Family flashed the lights more like .75s on /
   .25 off, so you'd probably want to create a custom version of the "flash"
   show for TAF that flashed them more like the original version.

``show_when_completed: on``
   Plays the show called "on" when this achievement is complete

``events_when_started: award_thing_multiball``
   Posts an event called *award_thing_multiball* when this achievement is
   started. We'll use this as the start event for the Thing Multiball mode.

``enable_events: initialize_mansion, reset_mansion``
   Enables this achievement when either of the events *initialize_mansion* or
   *reset_mansion* is posted. Prior to that, this achievement will be disabled.

``complete_events: award_thing_multiball``
   Watches for the event *award_thing_multiball*, and when it sees it, it marks
   this achievement as complete. Notice this is the same event that this
   achievement posts when it starts. In other words, we've configured it so
   the achievement is complete as soon as it starts! This is by design, because
   the rules state that once an achievement is awarded, the chair can be
   relit immediately, and it's possible to receive the next award even while
   the mode from the prior award is still running.

``reset_events: reset_mansion``
   Watches for an event called *reset_mansion* that will reset this achievement
   back to its initial (disabled) state.

This achievements configuration takes care of the following rules:

* Lights for incomplete awards are off.
* Complete awards are on solid.
* The currently selected award's light is flashing.

Step 3. Create an achievement group
-----------------------------------

Next we need to create an achievement group called "mansion_awards" which will
group the 12 mansion achievements together. That will look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: mansion_awards
   #! achievements:
   #!   9_mil:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   6_mil:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   3_mil:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   thing_multiball:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   quick_multiball:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   graveyard_at_max:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   raise_the_dead:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   festers_tunnel_hunt:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   lite_extra_ball:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   seance:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   hit_cousin_it:
   #!      show_tokens:
   #!   mamushka:
   #!      show_tokens:
   achievement_groups:
     mansion_awards:
       achievements:
           - 9_mil
           - 6_mil
           - 3_mil
           - thing_multiball
           - quick_multiball
           - graveyard_at_max
           - raise_the_dead
           - festers_tunnel_hunt
           - lite_extra_ball
           - seance
           - hit_cousin_it
           - mamushka
       show_tokens:
         lights: electric_chair_yellow, electric_chair_red
       auto_select: yes
       events_when_all_completed: select_tour_mansion
       enable_while_no_achievement_started: no
       show_when_enabled: on
       select_random_achievement_events: sw_jet
       allow_selection_change_while_disabled: yes
       disable_while_achievement_started: no
       start_selected_events: balldevice_electric_chair_ball_enter, balldevice_swamp_kickout_ball_enter, award_mansion_from_bear
       enable_events: light_chair
       disable_events: unlight_chair

Let's look at each of these settings:

``achievements:``
   This is just the list of the 12 achievements that make up this group.

``show_tokens:``
   These are the show tokens for the group itself. In this case they're the
   two lights on the electric chair, since those lights turn on and off
   to indicate whether the chair or swamp can be shot to award the currently
   selected item.

``auto_select: yes``
   This is used to make sure that one achievement is selected at all times.
   If the currently selected achievement is completed, the achievement group
   will notice that there is no currently selected achievement and it will pick
   one from random from the remaining achievements (those that are "enabled").

``events_when_all_completed: select_tour_mansion``
   Posts an event called *select_tour_mansion* once all 12 achievements in this
   group in complete. We'll use this later to light the "tour mansion" award.

``enable_while_no_achievement_started: no``
   In our case, we do not want to automatically enable the achievement group
   when no achievement is started, because the rules for Addams Family say that
   the player has to shoot the center ramp or right inlane to light the
   chair (which is enabling this achievement group).

``show_when_enabled: on``
   This plays the show called "on" when the achievement group is in the
   enabled state. This will have the effect of turning on the red and yellow
   chair lights (from the ``show_tokens:`` section) when the achievement
   group is enabled and the selected item can be awarded.

``select_random_achievement_events: sw_jet``
   In Addams Family, each pop bumper hit changes the currently selected
   mansion award. To make this happen, we added a tag called "jet" to the five
   pop bumper switches. (That will post an event called *sw_jet* any time one
   of these switches is hit. Then we add that event name here which will cause
   this achievement group to change the currently selected award.

``allow_selection_change_while_disabled: yes``
   The pop bumper hits to change the current selection happens regardless of
   whether the group is enabled (e.g. the chair is lit) or not, so we use this
   setting to allow that selection change to happen at any time.

``start_selected_events: balldevice_electric_chair_ball_enter, balldevice_swamp_kickout_ball_enter, award_mansion_from_bear``
   A shot to either the electric chair or the swamp kickout will award the
   selected achievement.

``enable_events: light_chair``
   When an event called *light_chair* is posted, this achievement group will
   be enabled (which will turn on the chair lights and allow the selected
   achievement to be started via the ``start_selected_events:``.

``disable_events: unlight_chair``
   When an event called *light_chair* is posted, this achievement group will
   be disabled. The chair lights will turn off, and the ``start_selected_events:``
   will not cause the current selected achievement to start.

This step takes care of:

* Hitting any pop bumper will change the currently selected award to another
  random from the awards that are not yet complete.
* The selected award is awarded / collected when the electric chair is lit
  (yellow and red lights on the chair toy) and either the electric chair or
  swamp shot is hit.

Step 4. Light the electric chair
--------------------------------

Now that we have the basic achievements and achievement group structure laid
out, let's focus on getting the chair lit. We'll look at the following four
rules:

* The electric chair is lit for 3 seconds after the right inlane is hit.
* The electric chair is lit indefinitely after either ramp is hit.
* The electric chair is lit at the beginning of each ball
* For awards that start modes, the chair can be relit and another award
  awarded even while the prior award's mode is running.

At first this seems pretty straightforward. If the center ramp is shot, post
an event to enable the achievement group. If the right inlane is hit, post
an event to enable the achievement group and also set a timer that will
disable it 3 seconds later. The problem with this is that if the chair was
previously lit from the ramp when the inlane is hit, we don't want the inlane
timer to disable the chair after 3 seconds.

There are several ways in MPF to achieve this. In our case, we're going to use
modes. (We really like :doc:`using modes for game logic </game_logic/modes/modes_as_game_logic>`.)

The two modes we're going to create are:

* chair_lit_3s
* chair_lit

The chair_lit_3s mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's look at the config for the "chair_lit_3s" mode:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: chair_lit_3s
   #config_version=5

   mode:
     priority: 101
     start_events: right_inlane_active
     stop_events:
       unlight_chair
       balldevice_electric_chair_ball_enter
       balldevice_swamp_kickout_ball_enter
       cancel_chair_timer

   event_player:
     mode_chair_lit_3s_started: light_chair
     timer_unlight_chair_complete: unlight_chair

   timers:
     unlight_chair:
       end_value: 3
       start_running: yes

Notice that this mode started when the *right_inlane_active* switch is hit,
which means it starts when the right inlane is hit. Pretty simple.

When it comes to stop events, we have four of them. First is
*unlight_chair*. This mode has a timer (for 3 seconds) which starts when the
mode starts, so when that completes, it posts *timer_unlight_chair_complete*
which the event player uses to post *unlight_chair* which will stop the mode.
(The *unlight_chair* event is also used by the mansion achievement group to
disable itself.

There are also stop events for *balldevice_electric_chair_ball_enter* and
*balldevice_swamp_kickout_ball_enter* which stop this mode if either of those
shots are hit. Notice those are also ``start_selected_events:`` for the
achievement group, so hitting either one of those will start the selected
achievement (if the group is enabled) and also stop this mode.

You may be wondering why we have both of those ball enter events listed here?
Why not just use an "events_when_started" setting in the achievement group to
stop this mode? The reason is for this rule here:

* Accumulating 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95 bear kicks (center ramp)
  collects the currently selected award (except Tour the Mansion), even if the
  chair is not lit.

This shot will "start" an award, but if the chair is lit, we do not want it
to unlight, so that's why we need to stop the chair_lit_3s mode based on the
actual chair or swamp being hit, not just any time the selected award is
started.

Finally, notice there's also an event called *cancel_chair_timer* which will
stop this mode. We'll talk about that in a bit.

The only other thing to discuss in this mode is the ``event_player:``. We talked
about the timer being used to post the *unlight_chair* event. But notice there's
also an entry ``mode_chair_lit_3s_started: light_chair`` which posts the
*light_chair* event when the mode starts. (This event is listed in the
achievement group as the event which enables it.) These settings, in combination,
mean that when the chair_lit_3s mode is running, the mansion achievement group
will be enabled (e.g. the chair is lit).

The chair_lit mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second mode we're going to create will be like the chair_lit_3s mode,
except instead of having a timer that stops the mode after 3 seconds, this
mode will stay active until the chair or swamp is hit. (Well, or until the
ball ends, as by default, all modes end when the ball ends automatically.)

Here's the config for this mode:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: chair_lit
   #config_version=5

   mode:
     priority: 102
     start_events: center_ramp_active, ball_starting
     stop_events:
       balldevice_electric_chair_ball_enter
       balldevice_swamp_kickout_ball_enter

   event_player:
     mode_chair_lit_stopping: unlight_chair
     mode_chair_lit_started: light_chair, cancel_chair_timer
     mode_chair_lit_3s_started: cancel_chair_timer

   counters:
      initialize_mansion:
         count_events: mode_chair_lit_started
         events_when_complete: initialize_mansion
         count_complete_value: 1
         persist_state: true

The ``start_events:`` are pretty straightforward. We start the mode when the
center ramp is hit, and also on *ball_starting* since the Addams Family rules
state that the chair is lit at the beginning of every ball.

This mode has an event_player to help with the logic. When this mode stops,
we also post the *unlight_chair* event which is one of the disable events
for the mansion achievement group. We also post the *light_chair* event when
the mode starts to enable the group.

The final two event player settings help us with the interaction between this
mode and the 3 second timed version. We have *cancel_chair_timer* as an event
that's fired when this mode starts too. Notice that that event is one of the
``stop_events`` for the other mode. The reason for this is that if the ball
hits the right inline and the chair is lit for 3 seconds, and then the ball
hits the center ramp within those 3 seconds, we need to make sure the chair
stays lit indefinitely, meaning we need to stop the 3s mode so it doesn't
shut the chair off. So that's what this event is doing.

Similarly if the player had previously hit the center ramp (which starts this
mode to light the chair), and then the player hits the right inline, we also
need to kill that 3s mode to make sure it doesn't turn off the chair, so we
do that with the event player setting ``mode_chair_lit_3s_started: cancel_chair_timer``.
Basically this setting means that if this mode sees the 3s mode, it shuts it
down. :) And obviously this shut down only happens if this mode is running.

What about that logic block? Let's discuss that in the next step...

Step 5. Select the proper award at game start
---------------------------------------------

One of the twists of the Addams Family mansion awards is that when the game
first starts, it always starts with either "Hit Cousin It" or "Mamuska"
selected. So we have to figure out a way to randomly pick from one of those
two (instead of all 12) at the start of the game, but then every random
choice after that has to be from all 12 (well, of the ones that have not yet
been awarded out of all 12.

We'll tackle this in two parts.

First, take a look at the Hit Cousin It and Mamuska achievements:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: mansion_awards
   achievements:
      hit_cousin_it:
        show_tokens:
          lights: hit_cousin_it
        show_when_selected: flash
        show_when_completed: on
        events_when_started: award_hit_cousin_it # starts hit_cousin_it mode
        complete_events: award_hit_cousin_it
        reset_events: reset_mansion

      mamushka:
        show_tokens:
          lights: mamushka
        show_when_selected: flash
        show_when_completed: on
        events_when_started: award_mamushka  # starts mamushka mode
        complete_events: award_mamushka
        reset_events: reset_mansion

Notice that they're slightly different than the other 10 mansion awards in that
they do NOT have enable events.

The reason for this is that devices in MPF that have enable_events in their
configurations are NOT automatically enabled when they're created. (This is
because MPF thinks, "Hey, you have enable events, so you have some way to
enable them, so you can enable them whenever you want." But if there are no
enable events, like these two, then MPF will enable them immediately.)

This means that when this mode first starts and these 12 mansion achievements
are created, the ``hit_cousin_it`` and ``mamuska`` achievements are enabled
immediately (since they don't have enable events), and the other 10 mansion
awards are disabled (since they do have enable events). Since the achievement
group is configured for ``auto_select: yes``, it will automatically (and
immediately) pick one of the enabled achievements which will change into the
selected state (and start it's select show, etc.). This means that the initial
selection will always be one of those two.

However, once the initial selection is made, we need a way to enable the
remaining 10 mansion awards. For this we'll use a counter logic block:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: chair_lit
   # This is in the chair_lit mode config, NOT machine-wide config

   counters:
      initialize_mansion:
         count_events: mode_chair_lit_started
         events_when_complete: initialize_mansion
         count_complete_value: 1
         persist_state: true

This is a simple counter that "counts" the *mode_chair_lit_started*
event (which is posted by this mode once it's fully started and done
initializing). The count complete value is one, meaning that once it sees this
event once, it's done. We tell it to persist its state so that it remembers
where it was from ball-to-ball (meaning it will only run once ever in the game)
and when it's done (which is after it sees that event once) it will post the
event *initialize_mansion*.

(Remember that logic block states are stored on a per-player basis, so
everything we say happens "once" here is really "once per player".)

Note also that in the 10 "other" mansion achievements, we have
*initialize_mansion* listed as one of their enable events. This means that
when this counter completes its count (of 1) that it will post that event
which will enable the other 10 achievements.

At this point you'll have 1 achievement selected (which will be either Hit
Cousin It or Mamushka), and you'll have the other 11 in the "enabled" state.

Hitting a pop bumper will pick a new random selected achievement.

Step 6. Kick off the award
--------------------------

Next up we have an easy thing: Starting the modes and/or kicking off the
shows for each mansion award.

In this case, note that our 12 mansion achievements each have an
``events_when_started:`` setting with a unique event name, like
*award_seance* or *award_lite_extra_ball*. So just use that event to either
start a mode or to play a show. Simple!

* Some of the awards start modes, and others are instant awards with a short
  show. Collecting an award immediately turns its light on solid and selects
  another random uncollected award.

Step 7. Collect the selected award via the bear kick
----------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: Need to explain this fully

* Accumulating 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95 bear kicks (center ramp)
  collects the currently selected award (except Tour the Mansion), even if the
  chair is not lit.

Step 8. Setup the 3 Mil / 6 Mil linking
---------------------------------------

* If 3 Mil is awarded, 6 Mil is spotted (automatically set to complete) as
  well, and vice-versa.

This is pretty simple. Just add the events posted when one achievement is
started to the complete events for the other. Here are the examples:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! mode: mansion_awards
   achievements:
      6_mil:
         show_tokens:
            lights: 6_mil
         show_when_selected: flash
         show_when_completed: on
         events_when_started: award_6_mil  # instant points award & plays shows, also spots 3 mil
         enable_events: initialize_mansion, reset_mansion
         complete_events: award_6_mil, award_3_mil
         reset_events: reset_mansion

      3_mil:
         show_tokens:
            lights: 3_mil
         show_when_selected: flash
         show_when_completed: on
         events_when_started: award_3_mil  # instant points award & plays shows, also spots 6 mil
         enable_events: initialize_mansion, reset_mansion
         complete_events: award_3_mil, award_6_mil
         reset_events: reset_mansion

Notice that the 6_mil's ``complete_events:`` includes *award_3_mil* and vice-versa.

Step 8. Add 500k to the bonus for each award collected
------------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: Need to explain this fully

* Each award collected adds 500k to the bonus.

Step 9. Move on to Tour the Mansion after all 12 awards have been completed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: Need to explain this fully

* Once all 12 Mansion Awards have been collected, the Tour the Mansion light
  (the question mark at the top of the mansion) is selected.
* The electric chair must be lit in the same way as before, and then the shot
  must be made to the electric chair or the swamp as before.
* This starts the Tour the Mansion mode

Step 10. Reset everything when Tour the Mansion is complete
-----------------------------------------------------------

.. todo:: Need to explain this fully

* When Tour the Mansion completes, all the mansion awards are reset and a new
  random one is selected.
* If Tour the Mansion ends before the ball ends, no mansion award can be
  awarded until the next ball.
