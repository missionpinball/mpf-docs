Recipe: Skillshot (with Auto-Rotate)
==============================================

This guide shows you how to build an MPF config for a skillshot with
automatically-rotating targets. When the player's turn starts the target shots
will rotate one "lit" shot rapidly, and when the ball is plunged the rotation
will stop and the lit shot will flash as the skillshot target.


Step 1. Create a skillshot mode and shots
------------------------------------------

Skillshots are a self-contained set of rules, so it's wise to create a separate
mode that can be started when a player's ball starts and ended after the
skillshot is hit (or missed).

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  #config_version=5
  modes:
    - skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  switches:
    s_dropbank_1:
      number: 1
    s_dropbank_2:
      number: 2
    s_dropbank_3:
      number: 3
    s_dropbank_4:
      number: 4
    s_dropbank_5:
      number: 5
  lights:
    l_dropbank_1:
      number: 1
    l_dropbank_2:
      number: 2
    l_dropbank_3:
      number: 3
    l_dropbank_4:
      number: 4
    l_dropbank_5:
      number: 5

  ##! mode: skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  # mode will be defined below

The first thing our mode needs is :doc:`/config/shots`. Each possible target
will be a shot (in this example, we'll have five). Each shot has a switch,
a light, and a shot profile to track its state. The sample code below uses
dropbank switches for the skillshot, but you are free to use any switches you
like.

Each shot will also have unique ``advance_events`` configured, which will be
explained in detail in section 4. What's important to note now is that the first
shot includes ``advance_events: mode_skillshot_started`` so that this shot will
automatically light when the mode starts, as the first shot in the rotation.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  #! switches:
  #!   s_dropbank_1:
  #!     number: 1
  #!   s_dropbank_2:
  #!     number: 2
  #!   s_dropbank_3:
  #!     number: 3
  #!   s_dropbank_4:
  #!     number: 4
  #!   s_dropbank_5:
  #!     number: 5
  ##! mode: skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  #! shot_profiles:
  #!   skillshot_profile:
  #!     states:
  #!       - name: off
  mode:
    start_events: start_mode_skillshot_with_auto_rotate
    stop_events: stop_mode_skillshot_with_auto_rotate
    priority: 1000

  shots:
    skillshot_drop_1:
      switch: s_dropbank_1
      advance_events: mode_skillshot_with_auto_rotate_started, advance_skillshot_1
      profile: skillshot_profile
      show_tokens:
        leds: l_dropbank_1
    skillshot_drop_2:
      switch: s_dropbank_2
      advance_events: advance_skillshot_2
      profile: skillshot_profile
      show_tokens:
        leds: l_dropbank_2
    skillshot_drop_3:
      switch: s_dropbank_3
      advance_events: advance_skillshot_3
      profile: skillshot_profile
      show_tokens:
        leds: l_dropbank_3
    skillshot_drop_4:
      switch: s_dropbank_4
      advance_events: advance_skillshot_4
      profile: skillshot_profile
      show_tokens:
        leds: l_dropbank_4
    skillshot_drop_5:
      switch: s_dropbank_5
      advance_events: advance_skillshot_5
      profile: skillshot_profile
      show_tokens:
        leds: l_dropbank_5


Step 2. Create a profile for the targets
------------------------------------------

We can create a :doc:`shot_profile</config/shot_profiles>` for the targets that
starts with the light off, lights it solid after one advancement, and makes it
flash after a second advancement. By default, a shot will advance its profile
when the shot is hit, but we don't want that here so we'll set
``advance_on_hit: false``.

When the mode starts, all shots will be in the first profile state "off". The
first shot will immediately advance to the "on" state (from the
``advance_events: mode_skillshot_with_auto_rotate_started`` noted above). Every
time the shot group rotates, the next shot in sequence will shift to "on". This
creates the rotation effect of the lit shot moving across the targets.

When the ball is plunged, whichever shot is in the "on" state will be advanced
to the "lit" state and its light will flash. When any shot is hit, we'll check
whether it is "lit" or not to know whether the skillshot should be awarded.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  ##! mode: skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  shot_profiles:
    skillshot_profile:
      advance_on_hit: false
      states:
        - name: off
          show: off
        - name: on
          show: on
        - name: lit
          show: flash


Step 3. Create a shot_group for the lanes, and a rotation timer
----------------------------------------------------------------

To tell MPF that the five shots are related to each other, we create a
:doc:`shot_group</config/shot_groups>` with all the shots in it.

Shot groups are powerful because they control behavior of all the shots
together. In this case, we'll use our shot group control the rotation of the
shots, and a :doc:`timer</config/timers>` to trigger a rotation every
half-second.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  #! switches:
  #!   s_dropbank_1:
  #!     number: 1
  #!   s_dropbank_2:
  #!     number: 2
  #!   s_dropbank_3:
  #!     number: 3
  #!   s_dropbank_4:
  #!     number: 4
  #!   s_dropbank_5:
  #!     number: 5
  ##! mode: skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  #! shots:
  #!   skillshot_drop_1:
  #!     switch: s_dropbank_1
  #!   skillshot_drop_2:
  #!     switch: s_dropbank_2
  #!   skillshot_drop_3:
  #!     switch: s_dropbank_3
  #!   skillshot_drop_4:
  #!     switch: s_dropbank_4
  #!   skillshot_drop_5:
  #!     switch: s_dropbank_5

  shot_groups:
    skillshot:
      shots:
        - skillshot_drop_1
        - skillshot_drop_2
        - skillshot_drop_3
        - skillshot_drop_4
        - skillshot_drop_5
      rotate_events: timer_skillshot_rotate_tick

  timers:
    skillshot_rotate:
      tick_interval: 500ms
      start_running: true
      control_events:
        - event: s_plunger_lane_inactive
          action: stop

The ``rotate_events`` will move the state of the shots each time the
timer ticks, and the ball leaving the plunger lane will stop the timer
and thus stop the rotation.


Step 4. Flash the lit shot when the rotation stops
--------------------------------------------------

When the timer stops, one of the shots will be in the "on" state. Whichever
shot this is should be advanced to the "lit" state so the light is flashing,
and we can use conditional events to listen for the timer stop and advance
*only* the lit shot.

Shot profile states are numbered starting with zero, so our "off" state is
number 0 and the "on" state is number 1. The following code will only post the
advance event for a shot if that shot is in state number 1, a.k.a. "on".

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  ##! mode: skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  event_player:
    timer_skillshot_rotate_stopped:
      - advance_skillshot_1{device.shots.skillshot_drop_1.state==1}
      - advance_skillshot_2{device.shots.skillshot_drop_2.state==1}
      - advance_skillshot_3{device.shots.skillshot_drop_3.state==1}
      - advance_skillshot_4{device.shots.skillshot_drop_4.state==1}
      - advance_skillshot_5{device.shots.skillshot_drop_5.state==1}


Each shot configured in step 1 above has ``advance_events`` that correspond to
its shot number, so the above event player will trigger the correct shot to
advance to its "lit" state.


Step 5. Rewards for skillshot
-----------------------------

When the player hits the lit shot, they get an award of points. We can use the
:doc:`/config/variable_player` for this.

When a shot in a shot group is hit, the shot group will post an event with
the state name of the shot that was hit. This way, we can check when *any* shot
is hit rather than having to check each shot individually.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  ##! mode: skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  variable_player:
    skillshot_lit_hit:
      score: 20_000


Step 6. End the mode on skillshot hit, or any other hit
----------------------------------------------------------

After any skillshot shot is hit, the skillshot mode should end. We can again
use the shot group to detect *any* shot being hit, but we'll use a hit event
*without* a state name because it doesn't matter whether the shot was lit or
not.

We also want to end the skillshot mode if any other switch on the playfield
was hit, which we can detect from the *playfield_active* event. However, when
the skillshot is hit the *playfield_active* event will post before the
*skillshot_lit_hit* event, so if we end the mode immediately then no score will
be awarded. Instead, we add a 1 second delay after playfield activation before
ending the mode.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  ##! mode: skillshot_with_auto_rotate
  event_player:
    # Add these lines after timer_skillshot_rotate_stopped (defined above)
    skillshot_hit: stop_mode_skillshot
    playfield_active: stop_mode_skillshot|1s
