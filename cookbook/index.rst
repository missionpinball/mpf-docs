The MPF Cookbook
================

The MPF cookbook contains recipes (how to guides) which show you how you would
implement complex features in your pinball machines using MPF.

Here are the recipes that are done:

* :doc:`The Addams Family: Mansion Awards <TAF_mansion_awards>`
* :doc:`Attack From Mars: Super Jets <AFM_super_jets>`
* :doc:`Modifying the Game mode: Dual launch devices <dual_launch>`

If you've ever played a game and wondered, "How would I do that?" then let us
know and we'll write a recipe for it! And here's what's on our to-do list:

+ *Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure:* INDY rollover lanes and lane change
