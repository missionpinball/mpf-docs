The MPF Cookbook
================

The MPF cookbook contains recipes (how to guides) which show you how you would
implement features from real pinball machines using MPF.

If you've ever played a game and wondered, "How would I do that?" then let us
know and we'll write a recipe for it!

Here are the recipes that are done:

* :doc:`The Addams Family: Mansion Awards <TAF_mansion_awards>`
* :doc:`Attack From Mars: Super Jets <AFM_super_jets>`
* :doc:`Indiana Jones: Rollover Lanes (with Lane Change) <rollover_lanes_with_lane_change>`

And here's what's on our to-do list:

+ *Attack from Mars:* 5-Way Combo
+ *Red & Ted's RoadShow:* Bulldozer hits to ball lock & multiball
+ *Red & Ted's RoadShow:* City modes
+ *Centigrade 37:* Flip-flopping groups of lit targets
+ *Judge Dredd* DeadWorld ball lock and multiball
+ *Demolition Man* Crane elevator & unloader
