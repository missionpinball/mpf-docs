How to Guides ("Cookbook" Recipes)
==================================

We've created a bunch of "How To" guides to walk you through adding
very specific things to your game. Our intention is that you'll first
follow the :doc:`step-by-step tutorial </tutorial/index>` (in order) to get to the point
where you have a very basic running game, and then you can pick-and-
choose the specific How To guides you'd like to do next. The How To
guides are self-contained and can be done in any order.
