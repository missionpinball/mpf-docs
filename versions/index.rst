MPF Versions
============

Since MPF is a work-in-progress, we're making a lot of changes and progress with dozens
of code updates per week.

The links here explain how MPF version numbering works, what features are in what versions,
and a roadmap of ideas and plans for the future.

The latest released version of MPF is |release|, but the documentation you're reading now
is valid for MPF versions |version|.
