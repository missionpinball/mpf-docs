MPF Sound & Audio Technical Overview
====================================

The MPF MC Audio Interface is a custom audio Python extension library with features designed to
support common pinball sound requirements.  It is written on top of the SDL2 and SDL_Mixer
libraries that are installed with Kivy which is required to run the MPF MC software (no additional
installs necessary for the audio library).

The SDL2 library (`https://www.libsdl.org/ <https://www.libsdl.org/>`_) is responsible for all
low-level communications with the system audio hardware. The user selects the basic audio
interface settings: sample rate, output channels, and buffer size (defaults are provided).  These
settings are used to initialize the SDL2 library which then negotiates with the system audio
hardware to create a connection that is as close to the desired settings as possible. The SDL2
library is responsible for creating the main audio thread and calling the main audio callback
function at a fast enough rate to provide audio buffers to the hardware without any gaps in
playback.  It also provides the thread synchronization and protection utilized in the audio
library through its mutex-related functions. The audio library also uses the SDL2 audio format
conversion functions to convert between various low-level audio formats to communicate with the
system sound hardware.

SDL_Mixer (`https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/>`_)
is an add-on library for SDL2 that provides basic audio mixing, sound loading and playback, and
sound streaming capabilities.  The MPF MC audio interface does not use the mixing features of
SDL_Mixer. Instead, it mainly utilizes the sound file loading functions and streaming format
functions of the library.  The MPF MC audio library interfaces with SDL_Mixer as a custom music
player and outputs its sound through the SDL_Mixer music channel.

The audio interface is divided into tracks, which are analogous to channels on an audio mixer.
Each track can play up to 32 sounds simultaneously (the limit for each track is configurable) and
the output for each track is mixed together and fed to the SDL_Mixer track via the custom music
player function. All of the sound generation and mixing functions are C functions that run in
the SDL2 audio thread.

It is important to understand the threading models of both SDL2 and Python to avoid common
threading problems. Python supports multiple threads, however it uses a mechanism called the
"global interpreter lock" (GIL) to ensure that only one thread runs in the Python interpreter at
once.  This simplifies many low-level details.  SDL2 creates its own audio thread in which to
receive and process audio data and send it to the audio hardware.  As this audio thread is not a
Python thread, it does not interact with the GIL and therefore is unable to access any Python
objects within its context.  This means that only C types and data structures may be utilized in
the SDL_Mixer effect callback function; no Python objects can be used. Because the MPF MC is a
Python application, a Python extension library is the only choice in which to use the SDL_Mixer
and SDL2 libraries.  Since the extension library utilizes both Python and C objects, the GIL
needs to be managed in the audio library along with thread protection to avoid race conditions
and deadlocks. These design constraints led to the choice of using Cython (`http://cython.org/
<http://cython.org/>`_) as the language to implement the MPF MC audio library.  Cython is a
superset of the Python language that additionally supports calling C functions and using C types,
an ideal choice for wrapping external C libraries and using them in a Python application.

Sounds are MPF assets and are created by the MPF asset loader.  The actual sound loading code is
contained in the audio library and is performed by SDL_Mixer.  A Python container object wraps
the C object returned by the loading process.  This wrapper allows the sound data to be managed
by a Python object.  The audio library extracts the C object when necessary and passes it to the
audio thread where it can be used to generate audio.

The :doc:`sound_player: </config_players/sound_player>` enables MPF events to trigger sound actions,
such as play, stop, and stop looping. It is a config_player and runs as a plug-in in MPF and also
creates event handlers in MPF MC.  The audio library also generates MPF events for various sound
events (sound played, stopped, looping, etc.) and sends them to MPF via BCP.
