How to start MPF and run your game
==================================

MPF is a console-based application which you run from the command line.

The quick version
-----------------

#. Open a command prompt
#. Switch to your machine folder
#. Run ``mpf both``

Starting the MPF game engine and media controller together
----------------------------------------------------------

You can start both the MPF game engine and the :doc:`media controller </start/media_controller>`
at the same time with a single command.

Since this is done from the command line, you'll need to open a command line
window. On Windows, you can right-click on the Start Button (or whatever it's
called these days) and click the "Command Prompt". On Mac OS X you can run the
Terminal app. On Linux, well, if you're using Linux, you know what a command
line is. :)

From the command line, change to the directory which is the root of your machine
folder. This is the folder that contains your machine's ``config``, ``modes``,
``shows``, etc. folders.

.. note:: Prior to MPF 0.30, we recommended that you put your machine's folder
   in the ``/machine_files`` folder inside the MPF package. That is changed now,
   and you can put your machine folder(s) wherever you want. In fact now that
   MPF has a "real" installer, the MPF package folder is hidden deep inside
   your system.

Then run:

.. code-block:: console

   mpf both <enter>

The ``mpf both`` command is what we use and probably what you'll use 99% of the time.

Starting the MPF media controller
---------------------------------

Alternately you can choose to run just the media controller by itself (still
from within your machine folder) like this:

.. code-block:: console

    mpf mc <enter>

You should see a popup window and a bunch of stuff scroll by in the console.

Starting the MPF game engine
----------------------------

You can run the MPF game engine by itself by running:

.. code-block:: console

    mpf game <enter>

Note that if you do not have a media controller running, the game engine won't
start fully because it will get stuck trying to connect to the media controller.
To avoid this if you just want to run the game engine by itself, add the ``-b``
command line option. (Details below)

Specifying command-line options
-------------------------------

There are several command-like options you can use when you run MPF. To use them, add them *after* the name
of the MPF command you're running, like:

.. code-block:: console

   mpf game -x -v

   mpf mc -xvV

   mpf both -v -b

The full list of available commands is covered in the documentation for each command (discussed below).

Understanding how this works
----------------------------

When you install MPF, the command ``mpf`` is registered with your system. Then you can
open a command prompt and run "mpf" from any folder.

There are several sub-commands you can specify when you run MPF. You specify a
sub-command by running ``mpf <command>``. (Some mpf commands take additional
options).

Here's a list of valid MPF commands. Click on any one of them for full details and command-line options.

* :doc:`mpf <mpf>` (Starts the MPF game engine and other commands)
* :doc:`mpf game <commands/game>` (Starts the MPF game engine)
* :doc:`mpf mc <commands/mc>` (Starts the MPF Media Controller)
* :doc:`mpf both <commands/both>` (Starts both the MPF game engine and media controller at the same time)
* :doc:`mpf migrate <commands/migrate>` (Migrates older config and show files to the current version)
* :doc:`mpf hardware <commands/hardware>` (Scan, inspect and configure hardware)
* :doc:`mpf service <commands/service>` (Service command line interface)

Specifying BCP ports
--------------------

By default, the MPF game engine and the MC will connect via TCP port 5050.
:doc:`You can change that port to whatever you want though <ports>`.
