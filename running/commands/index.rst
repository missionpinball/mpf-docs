MPF commands
============

MPF offers multiple commandline commands.
Almost all of those commands should executed from within your MPF machine folder.

Usually you start MPF using:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mpf both

Alternatively your can run MPF and MC separately:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mpf game

and:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mpf mc


To start the interactive service cli run (start mpf both before):

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mpf service

If you want to see details about your hardware (do not run MPF in parallel):

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mpf hardware scan

To update the firmware of your hardware controllers (if supported by your platform):

.. code-block:: shell

   $ mpf hardware firmware_update
