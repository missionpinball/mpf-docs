MPF command-line utility
========================

When you install MPF, it registers an executable called ``mpf`` and puts it in your system path. Everything you do
with MPF will use this tool from the command line.

Simply running ``mpf`` by itself will start the MPF game engine and run whatever machine configuration is in the
current folder. But you can also use ``mpf`` to launch other things, like ``mpf mc`` to start the media controller, or
``mpf migrate`` to migrate your config files to the current version of MPF.

A full list of all the available commands, along with the various command line options, is `here </running/commands/index>`_.
