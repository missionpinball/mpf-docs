Developer Documentation
=======================

We talk a lot about how you don't have to be an experienced software developer to use MPF. However, if you are an
experienced developer, there are a few ways you can leverage your coding knowledge:

* You can add custom code to your machine for parts of your game where you'd rather write "real" code versus using
  config files.
* You can add custom code to handle unique and one-off hardware.
* You can write Python-based unit tests to test your machine.
* You can extend MPF to add features or to support new types of hardware.

Instructions for all of this, as well as an API reference, is available at the MPF Developer Documentation website:
