This guide will show you how to configure MPF to use an older-style drain
and trough combination that uses two coils (one to eject the ball from the
drain hole and a second to release a ball into the plunger lane).

This guide is written for the types of devices that have only have one switch
on the trough side, like this example of a Gottlieb System 3 machine (Brooks 'n
Dunn):

.. image:: /mechs/images/two_coil_one_switch_trough_photo.jpg

If your trough system  has multiple switches in the trough (one for
each ball), then use :doc:`this guide <two_coil_multiple_switches>` instead.

In the types of troughs this guide is for, a ball ejected from the drain over
the hump into the trough will only momentarily activate the trough switch as
the ball rolls by, unless the trough is full, in which case the last ball that
goes into it sits on the switch.

The following diagram shows a more clear view of the type of trough system this
guide is for: (This is a side view)

1. Add the switches
-------------------

The first step is to add all the switches to the ``switches:``
section of your config file. Create an entry in your ``switches:`` section for
the drain switch as well as each switch in your trough, like this: (This
example has three switches in the trough. Yours may have more or less.)

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    switches:
        s_drain:
            number: 1
        s_trough_enter:
            number: 2

Note that we configured this switches with numbers ``01`` and ``02``, but
you should use the actual switch numbers for your control system that the
switches are connected to. (See :doc:`/hardware/numbers` for instructions for
each type of control system.)

It makes no difference what the actual switch names are. We
use *s_drain* and *s_trough_entry*, though you can call them whatever you want.

2. Add the coils
----------------

Next, create the entries in your ``coils:`` section for the drain eject
coil and the trough release coil. Again, the names don't matter. We'll call
them *c_drain_eject* and *c_trough_release* and enter them like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    coils:
        c_drain_eject:
            number: 3
            default_pulse_ms: 20
        c_trough_release:
            number: 4
            default_pulse_ms: 20

Again, the ``number:`` entries in your config will vary depending on your actual
hardware, and again, you can pick whatever name you want for your coil.

You'll also note that we went ahead and entered ``default_pulse_ms:`` values of 20
which will override the default pulse times of 10ms. It's hard to say
at this point what values you'll actually need. You can always adjust
this at any time. You can play with the exact values in a bit once we
finish getting everything set up.

Note that some trough coils use a shorter pulse to pop the ball into the plunger
lane. However, some machines have gates or rotational devices that need to be
active for much longer. However, if the pulse time is over about 50ms, then
that coil should be enabled with PWM and disabled versus pulsed, so in that case,
you also need to add ``default_pulse_power:`` which tells MPF it's ok to enable
this coil (with 25% hold power in this case).

In other words, a trough with long release time would look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   coils:
        c_trough_release:
            number: 4
            default_pulse_ms: 20ms
            default_hold_power: 0.25

3. Add your "drain" ball device
-------------------------------

In MPF, anything that holds and releases a ball is a
:doc:`ball device </mechs/ball_devices/index>`. With this drain/trough setup,
there are actually two ball devicesâ€”one for the drain and a second for the
trough.

Let's add the drain device first, which we'll add to the ``ball_devices:``
section of your machine config. (If you don't have that section add it now.)

Then in your ``ball_devices:`` section, create an entry called ``bd_drain:``,
like this:

::

    ball_devices:
        bd_drain:

This means that you're creating a ball device called *bd_drain*.
We use the preface *bd_* to indicate that this is a ball device
which makes it easier when we're referencing them later. Then under
your ``bd_drain:`` entry, you'll start entering the
configuration settings for your drain ball device.

* Add ``ball_switches: s_drain`` which means this device will use the *s_drain*
  switch to know whether or not this device has a ball.
* Add ``eject_coil: c_drain_eject`` which is the name of the coil that will
  eject the ball from the drain.
* Add ``eject_targets: bd_trough`` which tells MPF that this ball device
  ejects its balls into the device called *bd_trough*. (We'll create that
  device in the next step.)
* Add ``tags: drain`` which tells MPF that balls entering this device mean that
  a ball has drained from the playfield.

Your drain device configuration should look now look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    #! switches:
    #!     s_drain:
    #!         number: 1
    #!     s_trough_enter:
    #!         number: 2
    #! coils:
    #!     c_drain_eject:
    #!         number: 3
    #!         default_pulse_ms: 20
    #!     c_trough_release:
    #!         number: 4
    #!         default_pulse_ms: 20
    ball_devices:
        bd_drain:
            ball_switches: s_drain
            eject_coil: c_drain_eject
            eject_targets: bd_trough
            tags: drain
    #!     bd_trough:
    #!         entrance_switch: s_trough_enter
    #!         entrance_switch_full_timeout: 500ms
    #!         ball_capacity: 3
    #!         eject_coil: c_trough_release
    #!         tags: trough, home

4. Add your "trough" ball device
--------------------------------

Next create a second entry in the ``ball_devices:`` section called ``bd_trough``
that will be for the trough device that holds the balls that are ejected from
the drain before they're released into the plunger lane.

The configuration is pretty straightforward:

* Add ``entrance_switch: s_trough_enter`` which tells MPF which switch is used
  as the "entrance" switch to this device. (An entrance switch is the switch
  that's momentarily activated as balls enter this device.)
* Add ``entrance_switch_full_timeout: 500ms`` which tells MPF that if the
  entrance switch stays active for more than this amount of time, that means
  that this device is full.
* Add ``ball_capacity: 3`` (or whatever the number of balls is that can be
  stored on the trough side). This tells MPF how many balls are in this device
  when a ball is sitting on the entrance switch.
* Add ``eject_coil: c_trough_release`` which is the name of the coil that will
  be pulsed to eject the ball from the drain.
* Add ``eject_targets: bd_plunger_lane`` which tells MPF that this ball device
  ejects its balls into the device called *bd_plunger_lane*. (We won't actually
  create the plunger device in this How To guide, but you need to have it, so
  see the :doc:`/mechs/plungers/index` documentation for full details since
  there are lots of different types of plungers.
* Add ``tags: home, trough`` which tells MPF that it's ok to store unused balls
  here and that it's ok for balls to be here when games start.

Your trough device configuration should look now look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    #! switches:
    #!     s_trough_enter:
    #!         number: 2
    #!     s_plunger:
    #!         number: 10
    #! coils:
    #!     c_trough_release:
    #!         number: 4
    #!         default_pulse_ms: 20
    ball_devices:
        bd_trough:
            entrance_switch: s_trough_enter
            entrance_switch_full_timeout: 500ms
            ball_capacity: 3
            eject_coil: c_trough_release
            eject_targets: bd_plunger_lane
            tags: trough, home
    #!     bd_plunger_lane:
    #!         ball_switches: s_plunger
    #!         mechanical_eject: true

If you need to enable ``c_trough_release`` for 1s (more than a few ms) it would look like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    #! switches:
    #!     s_trough_enter:
    #!         number: 2
    #!     s_plunger:
    #!         number: 10
    coils:
        c_trough_release:
            number: 4
            default_pulse_ms: 20ms
            default_hold_power: 0.25

    ball_devices:
        bd_trough:
            entrance_switch: s_trough_enter
            entrance_switch_full_timeout: 500ms
            ball_capacity: 3
            eject_coil: c_trough_release
            eject_coil_enable_time: 100ms
            eject_targets: bd_plunger_lane
            tags: trough, home
    #!     bd_plunger_lane:
    #!         ball_switches: s_plunger
    #!         mechanical_eject: true

5. Configure the balls installed
--------------------------------

One of the downsides of only having one switch in the trough is that if that
switch is not active, then MPF doesn't actually know how many balls are
in it. (In the example diagram at the beginning of this guide where the trough
can hold three balls, if that trough entry switch is not active, then there
could be zero, 1, or 2 balls in the trough.)

MPF is able to keep track of how many balls are in the trough by tracking balls
entered versus balls released. However when MPF starts up, if that entrance
switch isn't active, then it won't know how many balls are there.

There's a setting in the machine config called ``machine:balls_installed:``
that tells MPF how many actual balls are installed in the machine. So when
MPF starts, it can count up all the balls in all the devices and see if they're
all there or if any are missing. Since that's a bit tricky with the single
switch in the trough, you telling MPF how many total balls are installed in the
machine help it know what to do if that entrance switch isn't active when MPF
starts up.

Here's an example from the machine config:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    machine:
        balls_installed: 4

6. Configure your virtual hardware to start with balls in the trough
--------------------------------------------------------------------

While we're talking about the trough, it's probably a good idea to configure
MPF so that when you start it in virtual mode (with no physical hardware) that
it starts with the trough full of balls. To do this, add a new section to your
config file called ``virtual_platform_start_active_switches:``. (Sorry this
entry name is hilariously long.) As its name implies,
*virtual_platform_start_active_switches:* lets you list the names of
switches that you want to start in the "active" state when you're
running MPF with the virtual platform interfaces.

The reason these only work with the virtual platforms is because if you're
running MPF while connected to a physical pinball machine, it doesn't
really make sense to tell MPF which switches are active since MPF can
read the actual switches from the physical machine. So you can add
this section to your config file, but MPF only reads this section when
you're running with one of the virtual hardware interfaces. To use it,
simply add the section along with a list of the switches you want to
start active. For example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    #! switches:
    #!     s_trough_enter:
    #!         number: 2
    virtual_platform_start_active_switches:
        s_trough_enter

Here's the complete config
--------------------------

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    switches:
        s_drain:
            number: 01
        s_trough_enter:
            number: 02
        s_plunger:
            number: 10

    coils:
        c_drain_eject:
            number: 03
            default_pulse_ms: 20
        c_trough_release:
            number: 04
            default_pulse_ms: 20

    ball_devices:
        bd_drain:
            ball_switches: s_drain
            eject_coil: c_drain_eject
            eject_targets: bd_trough
            tags: drain
        bd_trough:
            entrance_switch: s_trough_enter
            entrance_switch_full_timeout: 500ms
            ball_capacity: 3
            eject_coil: c_trough_release
            eject_targets: bd_plunger
            tags: trough, home

        # bd_plunger is a placeholder just so the trough's eject_targets are valid
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger
            mechanical_eject: true

    playfields:
       playfield:
           default_source_device: bd_plunger
           tags: default

    machine:
        balls_installed: 4

    virtual_platform_start_active_switches:
        s_trough_enter
