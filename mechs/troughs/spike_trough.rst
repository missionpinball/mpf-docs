Unlike other troughs the Stern Spike trough contains an 74HCT165 chip and is
interfaced via SPI.
This is a problem if your platform is not using SPI to read switches (which
most platforms are not).
If you are on :doc:`Stern Spike </hardware/spike/index>` then just configure
your trough as described in :doc:`modern_opto`.

.. note::

   While the Stern Spike trough works with other platforms we do not recommend
   to buy it if you are not using the Stern Spike platform.
   Instead, if you did not yet buy a trough buy one with normal switches or
   optos (unless you are using Stern Spike).
   This will make your life easier.

Config (if you are not on Stern Spike):
---------------------------------------

If you got a Stern Spike trough but are not using
:doc:`Stern Spike </hardware/spike/index>` you can use our
:doc:`SPI Bit Bang platform </hardware/spi_bit_bang/index>` to read the
switches of your trough:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   hardware:
       platform: your_platform, spi_bit_bang    # add your platform first here

   spi_bit_bang:
