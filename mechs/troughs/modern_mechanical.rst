This guide will show you how to configure MPF to use a modern-style trough
which uses mechanical leaf switches. If you have a modern trough that uses
opto boards, use :doc:`this guide <modern_opto>` instead.

Here's an example from a Stern Star Trek Premium machine:

The following diagram shows how the ball flow and eject coil work in
a modern trough. (This is a side view)

And this diagram shows how the switches are typically arranged in a
modern trough with mechanical switches:

.. note::

   Not all modern troughs have the "jam" switch, and depending on how
   many balls were designed to go in your machine, it's possible that
   not all the ball switches are populated. (Though you can add more
   to increase the number of balls in your machine!)

1. Add your trough switches
---------------------------

The first step is to add your trough's switches to the ``switches:``
section of your config file. Create an entry in your ``switches:`` section for
each switch in your trough, like this: (This example has six switches plus the
jam switch. Yours may have more or less.)

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    switches:
        s_trough1:
            number: 2
        s_trough2:
            number: 3
        s_trough3:
            number: 4
        s_trough4:
            number: 5
        s_trough5:
            number: 6
        s_trough6:
            number: 7
        s_trough_jam:
            number: 8

Note that we configured this switches with numbers ``02`` through ``08``, but
you should use the actual switch numbers for your control system that the trough
switches are connected to. (See :doc:`/hardware/numbers` for instructions for
each type of control system.)

It makes no difference which switch is which (in terms of whether
Switch 1 is on the left side or the right side). Also the actual switch
names don't really matter. We use *s_trough1* through *s_trough6*
plus *s_trough_jam*, though you can call them *s_ball_trough_1* or
*trough_ball_1* or *s_mr_potatohead*.

.. note::

   The "jam" switch position is the switch which detects if a ball is sitting
   on top of the lowest ball. Not all troughs have this, so if yours doesn't,
   that's fineâ€”just don't enter it. (If you have it though you definitely want
   to use it because it makes MPF smarter about how it handles balls that get
   stacked.)

2. Add your trough eject coil
-----------------------------

Next, create an entry in your ``coils:`` section for your trough's eject
coil. Again, the name doesn't matter. We'll call this *c_trough_eject*
and enter it like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    coils:
        c_trough_eject:
            number: 4
            default_pulse_ms: 20

Again, the ``number:`` entries in your config will vary depending on your actual
hardware, and again, you can pick whatever name you want for your coil.

You'll also note that we went ahead and entered a ``default_pulse_ms:`` value of 20
which will override the default pulse time of 10ms. It's hard to say
at this point what value you'll actually need. You can always adjust
this at any time. You can play with the exact values in a bit once we
finish getting everything set up.

3. Add your "trough" ball device
--------------------------------

In MPF, the trough is a :doc:`ball device </mechs/ball_devices/index>`, so
you'll add a configuration for it to the ``ball_devices:`` section of your
machine config. (If you don't have that section add it now.)

Then in your ``ball_devices:`` section, create an entry called ``bd_trough:``,
like this:

::

    ball_devices:
        bd_trough:

This means that you're creating a ball device called *bd_trough*.
We use the preface *bd_* to indicate that this is a ball device
which makes it easier when we're referencing them later. Then under
your ``bd_trough:`` entry, start entering the
configuration settings for your trough ball device:

3a. Add your trough switches to your trough ball device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indented under ``bd_trough:``, create an entry called ``ball_switches:``
and then add a comma-separated list of all the switches in your trough, like
this:

::

            ball_switches: s_trough1, s_trough2, s_trough3, s_trough4, s_trough5, s_trough6, s_trough_jam

So this is eight spaces, followed by the word "ball_switches", then a
colon, then a space, then the name of your first switch, comma, then
your second switch, comma, etc...

Again these switches can be in any order. The key is that you're entering one
switch for each position that's used to detect whether a ball is in the trough
at that position.

If you have the switch in the jam position, enter it in this list too, since a
ball sitting on top of another one still "counts" as a ball in the trough.

The number of switches you enter here will tell MPF how many balls your trough
can hold. When MPF wants to know how many balls are in the trough, it
will check all these switches to see which ones are active, and the
total number active represents how many balls it's holding at that
moment.

3b. Add your eject coil to your trough ball device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next create a setting called ``eject_coil:`` which will be the name of
the coil that MPF should fire when it wants to eject a ball from the trough.
This should be the name of the coil you added in Step 2,
*c_trough_eject* in our case:

::

            eject_coil: c_trough_eject

Note that MPF will simply pulse the eject coil at its default pulse time
when it wants to eject a ball from the trough.

3c. Add some tags to tell MPF about this device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final configuration setting you need to enter for your trough is a
list of tags which tell MPF certain things about this device.

Tags are just a comma-separated list of words you add to the ``tags:`` setting
for a device. Ball devices can use some special tag names that tell MPF how it
should use it.

First, add a tag called ``trough`` which tells MPF that a ball device wants to
hold as many balls as it can. This probably doesn't make sense
right now, which is fine, but without this tag then MPF won't know
what to do with all the balls that are sitting in the trough waiting
to be launched. This tag tells MPF that it's fine for this device to
hold lots of balls.

Next, add a tag called ``home`` which tells
MPF that any balls in this device are considered to be in their "home"
positions. When MPF first starts up, and after a game ends, it will
automatically eject any balls from any devices that are not tagged
with "home." When a player tries to start a game, MPF will also make
sure all the balls in the machine are contained in devices tagged with
"home."

Finally, you need to add a tag called ``drain`` which is used to tell MPF that
a ball entering this device means that a live ball has drained from
the playfield. At this point you might be wondering why you have to
enter all three of these tags. Why can't the simple ``trough`` tag be
enough to tell MPF that a ball entering it should trigger a drain and
that balls are home? This is due to the flexibility of MPF and the
nearly unlimited variations of pinball machine hardware in the world.
Some machines have multiple troughs. Some machines have drain devices
which aren't troughs. Some machines consider balls outside the trough
to be home. So even though these all might seem similar, just know
that for now you have to add ``trough``, ``home``, and ``drain`` tags to
your trough. You can specify the tags in any order, and your ``tags:``
entry should look something like this:

::

            tags: trough, home, drain

3d. Add & configure your jam switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a jam switch, add a setting called ``jam_switch:`` and add it there,
like this:

::

            jam_switch: s_trough_jam

You can also configure an eject pulse time (in ms) that will be used when the
trough wants to eject a ball but the jam switch is active. You'll have to play
with your actual trough to see what this time should be. In most cases it's
actually *less* time than the regular eject pulse time, because in most cases,
the regular pulse time will kick out two balls (the jammed ball and the one
below it).

So for our example, we'll set the jam pulse time to 15ms.

::

            eject_coil_jam_pulse: 15ms

(Note that this setting is a time string, so you can include the "ms" in the
setting value.)

4. Configure your virtual hardware to start with balls in the trough
--------------------------------------------------------------------

While we're talking about the trough, it's probably a good idea to configure
MPF so that when you start it in virtual mode (with no physical hardware) that
it starts with the trough full of balls. To do this, add a new section to your
config file called ``virtual_platform_start_active_switches:``. (Sorry this
entry name is hilariously long.) As its name implies,
*virtual_platform_start_active_switches:* lets you list the names of
switches that you want to start in the "active" state when you're
running MPF with the virtual platform interfaces.

The reason these only work with the virtual platforms is because if you're
running MPF while connected to a physical pinball machine, it doesn't
really make sense to tell MPF which switches are active since MPF can
read the actual switches from the physical machine. So you can add
this section to your config file, but MPF only reads this section when
you're running with one of the virtual hardware interfaces. To use it,
simply add the section along with a list of the switches you want to
start active. For example:

::

    virtual_platform_start_active_switches:
        s_trough1
        s_trough2
        s_trough3
        s_trough4
        s_trough5
        s_trough6

5. Add your plunger lane
------------------------

Remember that ball devices in MPF know what their "target" devices are, meaning
that they understand the chain of devices the ball path takes. (For example, the
trough ejects to the plunger lane which ejects to the playfield which drains to
the trough...)

So in order to completely configure your trough, you need to tell it the name of
thes devices that it ejects to. For the purposes of this How To guide, we'll
just create a placeholder plunger lane called *bd_plunger*, though you should
see the :doc:`/mechs/plungers/index` documentation for full details since there
are lots of different types of plungers.

You add an eject target via the ``eject_targets:`` section, like this:

::

            eject_targets: bd_plunger

Of course you should enter the name of your actual plunger lane / ball launcher
device.

Note that the ``eject_targets:`` entry is "targets" (plural), but in this case
we're only adding a single target. That's fine and how you would configure a
trough since it only ejects to one place (the plunger lane). Some devices eject
to pathways with diverters which can direct the ball to multiple different
places, so that's the scenario where you'd enter more than one target. But for
the trough, it's just the one.

Here's the complete config
--------------------------

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    switches:
        s_trough1:
            number: 2
        s_trough2:
            number: 3
        s_trough3:
            number: 4
        s_trough4:
            number: 5
        s_trough5:
            number: 6
        s_trough6:
            number: 7
        s_trough_jam:
            number: 8
        s_plunger:
            number: 10

    coils:
        c_trough_eject:
            number: 4
            default_pulse_ms: 20

    ball_devices:
        bd_trough:
            ball_switches: s_trough1, s_trough2, s_trough3, s_trough4, s_trough5, s_trough6, s_trough_jam
            eject_coil: c_trough_eject
            tags: trough, home, drain
            jam_switch: s_trough_jam
            eject_coil_jam_pulse: 15ms
            eject_targets: bd_plunger

        # bd_plunger is a placeholder just so the trough's eject_targets are valid
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger
            mechanical_eject: true

    playfields:
       playfield:
           default_source_device: bd_plunger
           tags: default

    virtual_platform_start_active_switches:
        s_trough1
        s_trough2
        s_trough3
        s_trough4
        s_trough5
        s_trough6

What if it doesn't work?
------------------------

If you've gotten this far and your trough isn't working right, there
are a few things you can try (depending on what your problem is).

First, add a ``debug: true`` entry into your trough config in the
``ball_devices:`` section. Then when you run with verbose logging (``-v``),
you'll get extra debugging information in the log.

If your log file shows a number of balls contained in your trough that
doesn't match how many balls you actually have, that could be:

* You didn't add all the ball switches to the *ball_switches:*
  section of the trough configuration
* You're using a physical machine but a switch isn't adjusted
  properly so the ball is not actually activating it. (Seriously, we
  can't tell you how many times that's happened! We've also found that
  on some machines, if you only have one ball in the trough that the
  single ball isn't heavy enough to roll over the top of the eject coil
  shaft. In that case we just add a few more balls to the machine and it
  seems to take care of it.) Either way, if you have a ball in the
  trough, the switch entry in your log should show that the switch is
  active (*State:1*), like this:

::

    2014-10-27 20:05:29,891 : SwitchController : <<<<< switch: trough1, State:1 >>>>>

If you see State:1 immediately followed by another entry with State:0,
that means the ball isn't activating the switch even though it might
be in the trough.

If you get a YAML error, a "KeyError", or some other
weird MPF error, make sure that all the switch and coil names you
added to your trough configuration exactly match the switch and coil
names in the ``switches:`` and ``coils:`` sections of your config file.

Also make sure that all your names are allowable names, meaning they are only
letters, numbers, and the underscore, and that none of your names start with a
number.
