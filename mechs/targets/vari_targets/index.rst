Mission Pinball Framework's (MPF) *vari target* device represents a switch in a
pinball machine.
It is a metal arm that pivots under the playfield and awards a scoring value
associated with it that changes depending on how hard the ball hits it.
Typically the harder the ball hit the more points awarded.

This is a vari-target in a Gottlieb Playball (1971):

Technically, a vari-target has one switch per position and a reset coil to
reset the target:

It can reset the target at any position.
Either directly after a hit or once it has moved till the end (or never).
This is how a vari-target looks fully engaged:
