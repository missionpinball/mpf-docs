Ramps, loops or orbits usually contain two switches.
One at the entry and one to signal success.
To detect only shots where both switches were hit in order you can use
:doc:`sequence_shots </config/sequence_shots>`.

:doc:`TODO: Add a picture of an orbit </about/help_us_to_write_it>`

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
     s_ramp_entry:
       number: 1
     s_ramp_success:
       number: 2

   sequence_shots:
        ramp:
            switch_sequence: s_ramp_entry, s_ramp_success
            sequence_timeout: 3s

Additionally, most machines usually play a sound once the entry is hit to
signal the player that he hit the ramp and another sound on success to
indicate that the ball made it. You can use :doc:`/config/sound_player` to
achieve that. In this example you would use the events
``s_ramp_entry_active`` and ``ramp_hit`` to play the sounds:


.. code-block:: mpf-config

   sound_player:
     s_ramp_entry_active: indicate_ramp
     s_ramp_success: indicate_ramp_success
