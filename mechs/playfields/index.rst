Believe it or not, the playfield in MPF is technically a :doc:`ball device </mechs/ball_devices/index>`.
This is needed since MPF wants to know where all the balls are at all
times, so it needs to know which balls are "in" the playfield device.

:doc:`TODO: Add a picture of a playfield </about/help_us_to_write_it>`

The playfield is also responsible for tracking balls that
"disappeared" from it without going into other devicesâ€”-a process which
kicks off the :doc:`ball search </game_logic/ball_search/index>`.
The default playfield ball device (called
*playfield*) is created automatically based on settings in the
``mpfconfig.yaml`` default configuration file. Most machines only have
one playfield, though if you have a mini-playfield or a head-to-head
machine then you can configure additional playfield devices.

Ball tracking and ball search is performed per playfield in MPF.
Therefore, most devices in MPF belong to one playfield and mark it as active
when they see a ball.
You should configure the exact playfield for every device as soon as you have
more than one playfield in your machine.
Otherwise, MPF will complain about unexpected balls (e.g. you will see
:doc:`/events/unexpected_ball_on_playfield` events), ball search might
at the wrong time and ball tracking might go haywire.
To transfer balls you can use :doc:`playfield transfer <playfield_transfer>`
or :doc:`ball devices </mechs/ball_devices/index>`.
A ball device might capture from one playfield and eject to another.

Playfields are configured in the :doc:`playfields: section </config/playfields>`
of the configuration file.

Monitorable Properties
----------------------

For :doc:`dynamic values </config/instructions/dynamic_values>` and
:doc:`conditional events </events/overview/conditional>`,
the prefix for playfields is ``device.playfields.<name>``.
