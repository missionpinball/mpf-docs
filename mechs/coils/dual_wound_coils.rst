A *dual-wound coil* is a coil (solenoid) with two windings--one "strong"
power (or "main") winding for moving the coil, and a second weaker / lower-power
winding for "holding" the coil in the active position.


Dual-wound coils are typically used for flippers, diverters, gates, and
other devices in pinball machines that need a strong initial movement
followed by an extended hold period.

There are many places in MPF config files where you need to specify a coil name.
Rather than adding dual-wound coil logic in many different sections of MPF, we
have a dual-wound coil config where you can specify the settings for a
particular dual-wound coil (and give it a new name), and then you can use that
dual-wound coil anywhere in MPF that a coil is configured.

Hardware
--------

Dual wound coils are like two coils in one but instead of two times two
terminals they only have three terminals.
Both coils share one of those terminals.
Unfortunately, this is not standardized and different for different types of
coils.

To make sure you connect things right you need a multimeter and measure the
resistance between all three terminals.
It might be wise to remove all free-fly diodes while measuring (or at least
make sure to measure the inverse direction).
You are looking for the main coil with low resistance (2-20 Ohm) and one with
higher resistance (50 to 200 Ohm).
You can look up the expected resistance in one of the linked charts in our
:doc:`coil hardware section </mechs/coils/index>`.

Assumed you now got those three measurements:

 * Terminal 1 to 2: 4 Ohm
 * Terminal 2 to 3: 124 Ohm
 * Terminal 1 to 3: 120 Ohm

What does that mean?
It means that your main coil is between terminal 1 and 2 and your hold coil is
between terminal 1 and 3.
Terminal 2 and 3 is just the sum of the resistance of both coils.
In general, the highest of the three readings is the combination you want to
remove from your list.

How do you connect that?
Typically, driver boards connect your coils to ground so you connect power to
the terminal which is common between both coils.
In this case this would be terminal 1.
Terminal 2 and 3 would be connected to your driver board.

.. warning::

   Please make sure that any diodes on your coil are in reverse to the voltage
   (i.e. the stripe needs to be at the HV side).
   This is often not the case for older coils as they have been connected
   differently in older machines.
   Ignoring this will fry the FET on your driver board.


See :doc:`coil hardware </mechs/coils/index>` for more details about the
current, resistance, number of windings and the strength of coils.

Config
------

This is an example for dual-wound coils which are configured separately:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    coils:
      c_your_coil_main:
        number: 00   # depends on your platform and hardware
        default_pulse_ms: 20
      c_your_coil_hold:
        number: 01   # depends on your platform and hardware
        default_pulse_ms: 10
        default_hold_power: .2

On top of that you can configure :doc:`/config/dual_wound_coils` or other
devices such as :doc:`/config/flippers`.
