This guide shows you how to configure a traditional mechanical spring plunger
with MPF.

This guide is for use with a plunger lane that has a switch in the lane which
is activated by a ball waiting to be plunged, like this:

.. image:: /mechs/images/plunger_with_switch.jpg

If you have a mechanical spring plunger but you do NOT have a switch there,
then follow the :doc:`mechanical_no_switch` guide instead.

If you have a mechanical spring plunger that also has an "auto launch" coil
fired option, then follow the :doc:`auto_manual` guide instead.

1. Add the switch
-----------------

The first step is to add your plunger lane switches to the ``switches:``
section of your machine config file. Here's an example:


.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      s_plunger_lane:
         number: 2-6

Note that we configured this switches as number ``2-6``, but
you should use the actual switch numbers for your control system that the switches
are connected to. (See :doc:`/hardware/numbers` for instructions for
each type of control system.)

Be sure to set the ``type: NC`` if this switch is an opto and to configure
the other switch settings as needed.

2. Add your plunger ball device
-------------------------------

Remember a :doc:`ball device </mechs/ball_devices/index>` is anything in your pinball
machine that holds a ball (even if it's just for a short time). So your plunger lane
is a ball device.

In this case, you can add an entry for your plunger to the ``ball_devices:`` section
of your machine-wide config, and then create sub entries for the ball switch.

Here's an example. Note that in this case, we've left out the other ball devices
(such as your trough and/or drain):


.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            mechanical_eject: true

In the example above, we named the plunger device *bd_plunger*, but if course you can
name it whatever you want. You might use *bd_right_plunger* and
*bd_left_plunger* for a game like *Red & Ted's Road Show* that has plunger
lanes on both sides.

Note that the ``ball_switches:`` entry will just be a single switch, which is fine.
Since there's only one switch listed in the ``ball_switches:`` section, that will tell
MPF that this device can hold one ball.

3. Add the mechanical eject setting
-----------------------------------

Most ball devices in MPF have a coil which MPF pulses to eject a ball from the
device. But in the case of a mechanical spring-powered plunger, there is no
coil to eject the ball.

In this case, you have to tell MPF that this device has a mechanical eject
option, which basically lets MPF know that the ball might suddenly disappear
from this device, and when that happens, and eject attempt has been made.

To do that, add ``mechanical_eject: true`` to your plunger device, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            mechanical_eject: true

4. Configure the eject confirmation, target & timeouts
------------------------------------------------------

Next you need to configure some settings that will let your plunger know whether
ball launch events were successful.

The first setting is called ``eject_targets:``. (You may remember this from when
you :doc:`configured your trough or drain device </mechs/troughs/index>`.) This
setting is a list of one (or more, if there's a diverter) ball devices that your
plunger lane ejects into.

In probably 99% of cases, the plunger device only ejects to the playfield. In that
case you do *not* need to configure your ``eject_targets:`` because the playfield is
the default setting.

However, if your plunger lane ejects to some other device (maybe another launcher or
a subway or something) other than the playfield, then you'd configure that here.

Next up is the ``confirm_eject_type:`` which is how MPF knows that a ball really
made it out of the plunger and won't fall back in.

In most cases, the default setting of "target" is fine (because that means that MPF
just watches for the target device (from above) to get a ball, and when it does, it
assumes the eject from this device was successful.

However, plunger lanes that eject to the playfield sometimes have a switch that's
activated when the ball leaves the plunger. You can use this switch with a few
caveats:

* If this switch has been hit, it means the ball is out for sure, and it's not
  possible for it to roll back.
* This switch must always be hit, e.g. the ball can't sneak around it.
* No other balls should be able to hit this switch while they're in play.

What this means is that this switch is pretty limited and almost never used.

Finally, you need to configure the ``eject_timeouts:`` which is a time setting
for how long MPF will wait to confirm the eject. If a ball re-enters that
device before the timeout happens, then MPF assumes the eject failed and will
try it again.

For the ``eject_timeouts:``, you want to figure out what the MAXIMUM time is
that a ball could be ejected from the plunger but still not make it all the
way out and then fall back into the plunger. You'll have to play with this
setting in your machine, but in most machines it's probably around 3s.

Here are some examples of these settings in action.

First, for a typical coil-fired plunger lane / catapult that ejects the ball
directly to the playfield: (This is probably 99% of all cases)

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
            # ...
            eject_timeouts: 3s

Next, for a coil-fired plunger that has a switch at the exit of the plunger
lane that is only hit if the ball has made it out of the plunger and cannot
be hit by a random ball on the playfield:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_plunger_lane_exit:
   #!       number: 2-7
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
            # ...
            confirm_eject_type: switch
            confirm_eject_switch: s_plunger_lane_exit
            eject_timeouts: 3s

Next, if your plunger lane ejects into another ball device (a cannon, in this
case):

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_canon:
   #!       number: 3-1
   #! coils:
   #!    c_canon:
   #!       number: 2-2
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
   #!      bd_cannon:
   #!          ball_switches: s_canon
   #!          eject_coil: c_canon
        bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
            # ...
            eject_targets: bd_cannon
            eject_timeouts: 2s

5. Set your trough/drain device eject_targets
---------------------------------------------

Once you have your plunger device set up, you need to go back to your trough
or ball drain device and add the new plunger to your trough's ``eject_targets:``,
like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_trough1:
   #!       number: 3-1
   #!    s_trough2:
   #!       number: 3-2
   #!    s_trough3:
   #!       number: 3-3
   #!    s_trough4:
   #!       number: 3-4
   #!    s_trough_jam:
   #!       number: 3-5
   #! coils:
   #!    c_trough_eject:
   #!       number: 2-2
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_trough:
            ball_switches: s_trough1, s_trough2, s_trough3, s_trough4, s_trough_jam
            eject_coil: c_trough_eject
            tags: trough, home, drain
            jam_switch: s_trough_jam
            eject_coil_jam_pulse: 15ms
            eject_targets: bd_plunger
   #!      bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          mechanical_eject: true

Of course you'd add the name that you gave your plunger device, which could
be something like "bd_catapult" or whatever you called it.

Also, if you have a two-stage drain (like a System 11 machine), you'd add
this to the second device (the one that feeds the plunger).

6. Add the plunger als default_source_device
--------------------------------------------

Next you need to add your plunger lane ball device as ``default_source_device`` to
your playfield to tell MPF that this ball device is used to add a new ball
into play.

To do that, add your new plunger ball device as ``default_source_device`` in
the default ``playfield``, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #! ball_devices:
   #!     bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
   playfields:
       playfield:
           default_source_device: bd_plunger
           tags: default

7. Tag your playfield switches
------------------------------

Since the plunger lane ejects balls to the playfield, it's important that you
have your playfield switches tagged properly since that's how MPF knows that
a ball is loose on the playfield.

See the :doc:`/mechs/playfields/ball_tracking` documentation for details.

Complete config example
-----------------------

Here's a complete machine config with a "standard" coil-fired plunger that
ejects the ball directly to the playfield. Note that this config does not
include the switches and coils for the trough.

This config is what probably 99% of machines with coil-fired plungers will use:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      s_plunger_lane:
         number: 2-6
      s_launch_button:
         number: 1-5
      s_trough1:
         number: 3-1
      s_trough2:
         number: 3-2
      s_trough3:
         number: 3-3
      s_trough4:
         number: 3-4
      s_trough_jam:
         number: 3-5

   coils:
        c_trough_eject:
            number: 3-1
            default_pulse_ms: 20

   ball_devices:

        bd_trough:
            ball_switches: s_trough1, s_trough2, s_trough3, s_trough4, s_trough_jam
            eject_coil: c_trough_eject
            tags: trough, home, drain
            jam_switch: s_trough_jam
            eject_coil_jam_pulse: 15ms
            eject_targets: bd_plunger

        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            mechanical_eject: true
            eject_timeouts: 3s

   playfields:
       playfield:
           default_source_device: bd_plunger
           tags: default
