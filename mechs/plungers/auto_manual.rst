This guide explains how to configure a "combo" plunger lane which has both
a mechanical spring-powered plunger as well as a coil-fired auto plunge option.

Here's an example of this:

.. image:: /mechs/images/auto_manual_plunger.jpg
.. image:: /mechs/images/auto_launcher_side.jpg
.. image:: /mechs/images/auto_launcher_bottom.jpg

If you have a purely mechanical plunger with no autolaunch option, follow the
:doc:`mechanical_with_switch` guide instead. If you have a standard coil-fired
plunger or launch device with no mechanical spring plunger, follow the
:doc:`coil_fired` guide instead.

.. note::

   If you're reading through this guide and comparing it to the guide for the
   coil-fired plunger lane, you'll find that they're almost identical, except
   that this guide adds the ``mechanical_eject: true`` setting to the plunger.

1. Add the switches
-------------------

The first step is to add your plunger's switches to the ``switches:``
section of your machine config file. Create an entry in the ``switches:`` section
for the switch which is in the plunger lane that's activated by a ball waiting
to be plunged.

You might also have a button which the player can hit to launch balls into play.
Some machines have this (Like *Stern Star Trek* with the button on the apron),
while others only let the player launch the ball with spring plunger and they
use the coil for ball save and multiballs only.

So add one (or both, if you have a launch button) to your machine config if you
haven't done so already:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      s_plunger_lane:
         number: 2-6
      s_launch_button:
         number: 1-5

Note that we configured this switches with numbers ``2-6`` and ``1-5``, but
you should use the actual switch numbers for your control system that the switches
are connected to. (See :doc:`/hardware/numbers` for instructions for
each type of control system.)

Be sure to set the ``type: NC`` if either of these switches is an opto and to configure
the other switch settings as needed.

2. Add the coil
---------------

Next, create an entry in your ``coils:`` section of your machine config file
for your plunger lane's eject coil. Again, the name doesn't matter. We'll call this
*c_plunger* and enter it like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    coils:
        c_plunger:
            number: 2-1
            default_pulse_ms: 20

Again, the ``number:`` entries in your config will vary depending on your actual
hardware, and again, you can pick whatever name you want for your coil.

You'll also note that we went ahead and entered a ``default_pulse_ms:`` value of 20
which will override the default pulse time of 10ms. It's hard to say
at this point what value you'll actually need. You can always adjust
this at any time. You can play with the exact values in a bit once we
finish getting everything set up.

3. Add your plunger / launcher ball device
------------------------------------------

Remember a :doc:`ball device </mechs/ball_devices/index>` is anything in your pinball
machine that holds a ball (even if it's just for a short time). So your plunger lane /
ball launcher is a ball device.

In this case, you can add an entry for your plunger to the ``ball_devices:`` section
of your machine-wide config, and then create sub entries for the ball switch and
eject coil.

Here's an example. Note that in this case, we've left out the other ball devices
(such as your trough and/or drain):

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            eject_coil: c_plunger

In the example above, we named the plunger device *bd_plunger*, but if course you can
name it whatever you want. You might use *bd_catapult* for a catapult-style launcher, or
*bd_right_plunger* and *bd_left_plunger* for a game like Judge Dredd that has plunger
lanes on both sides.

Note that the ``ball_switches:`` entry will just be a single switch. It's the switch that's
active when a ball is sitting in the plunger waiting to be launched. (This is NOT the
switch the player hits to launch the ball if you have one of those.)

Since there's only one switch listed in the ``ball_switches:`` section, that will tell
MPF that this device can hold one ball.

4. Add the mechanical eject setting
-----------------------------------

Since your plunger ball device has an option for the player to manually plunge
the ball with the spring rod, we need to give MPF a "heads up" that a ball
sitting in the plunger lane might suddenly disappear, and that when that
happens, that means the player has attempted to eject the ball from this device.

To do that, add ``mechanical_eject: true`` to your plunger device, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            eject_coil: c_plunger
            mechanical_eject: true

5. (Optional) Configure the launch switch
-----------------------------------------

If your machine also has a launch button which you'd like to (optionally) use
for the player to hit to launch the ball into play with the plunger lane's
eject coil, then you can add a setting called ``player_controlled_eject_event:``.

At this point, you might be wondering why we configure a player controlled eject
"event". Why is it an "event" and not a "switch"?

This is due to MPF's flexibility to support the myriad of different types of machines
in the world.

For example, some machines launch the ball when a player hits a button. Others launch
it when the player *releases* a button. Still others play a little show then launch. Etc.

So we decided, "Hey, we have this great events system in MPF, so let's just use that."

Remember that by default, there are "active" events that are posted when a switch
becomes active, and "inactive" events that are posted when a switch that was active
becomes inactive.

5.1 Launching the ball when a player hits the launch button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assuming the switch tied to the launch button (or gun trigger or fishing rod button or
whatever you have) is called *s_launch_button*, then that means an event called
*s_launch_button_active* will be posted as soon as that switch is hit. In that case,
you'd configure your plunger like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_launch_button:
   #!       number: 1-5
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            eject_coil: c_plunger
            mechanical_eject: true
            player_controlled_eject_event: s_launch_button_active

Pretty straightforward.

5.2 Launching the ball when a player releases the launch button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to launch the ball into play when the player *releases* the launch button,
then just use that switch's inactive event:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_launch_button:
   #!       number: 1-5
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            eject_coil: c_plunger
            mechanical_eject: true
            player_controlled_eject_event: s_launch_button_inactive

Note that whenever the ``player_controlled_eject_event:`` is used, MPF has to
specifically enable the ability for that event to eject a ball. In other words, you
don't have to worry about the player hitting that switch to launch extra balls into
play, and it's fine if that event is posted in other places in your game.

6. Configure the eject confirmation, target & timeouts
------------------------------------------------------

Next you need to configure some settings that will let your plunger know whether
ball launch events were successful.

The first setting is called ``eject_targets:``. (You may remember this from when
you :doc:`configured your trough or drain device </mechs/troughs/index>`.) This
setting is a list of one (or more, if there's a diverter) ball devices that your
plunger lane ejects into.

In probably 99% of cases, the plunger device only ejects to the playfield. In that
case you do *not* need to configure your ``eject_targets:`` because the playfield is
the default setting.

However, if your plunger lane ejects to some other device (maybe another launcher or
a subway or something) other than the playfield, then you'd configure that here.

Next up is the ``confirm_eject_type:`` which is how MPF knows that a ball really
made it out of the plunger and won't fall back in.

In most cases, the default setting of "target" is fine (because that means that MPF
just watches for the target device (from above) to get a ball, and when it does, it
assumes the eject from this device was successful.

However, plunger lanes that eject to the playfield sometimes have a switch that's
activated when the ball leaves the plunger. You can use this switch with a few
caveats:

* If this switch has been hit, it means the ball is out for sure, and it's not
  possible for it to roll back.
* This switch must always be hit, e.g. the ball can't sneak around it.
* No other balls should be able to hit this switch while they're in play.

What this means is that this switch is pretty limited and almost never used.

Finally, you need to configure the ``eject_timeouts:`` which is a time setting
for how long MPF will wait to confirm the eject. If a ball re-enters that
device before the timeout happens, then MPF assumes the eject failed and will
try it again.

For the ``eject_timeouts:``, you want to figure out what the MAXIMUM time is
that a ball could be ejected from the plunger but still not make it all the
way out and then fall back into the plunger. You'll have to play with this
setting in your machine, but in most machines it's probably around 3s.

Here are some examples of these settings in action.

First, for a typical coil-fired plunger lane / catapult that ejects the ball
directly to the playfield: (This is probably 99% of all cases)

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          eject_coil: c_plunger
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
            # ...
            eject_timeouts: 3s

Next, for a coil-fired plunger that has a switch at the exit of the plunger
lane that is only hit if the ball has made it out of the plunger and cannot
be hit by a random ball on the playfield:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_plunger_lane_exit:
   #!       number: 2-7
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          eject_coil: c_plunger
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
            # ...
            confirm_eject_type: switch
            confirm_eject_switch: s_plunger_lane_exit
            eject_timeouts: 3s

Next, if your plunger lane ejects into another ball device (a cannon, in this
case):

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_canon:
   #!       number: 3-1
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   #!    c_canon:
   #!       number: 2-2
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
   #!      bd_cannon:
   #!          ball_switches: s_canon
   #!          eject_coil: c_canon
        bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          eject_coil: c_plunger
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
            # ...
            eject_targets: bd_cannon
            eject_timeouts: 2s

7. Set your trough/drain device eject_targets
---------------------------------------------

Once you have your plunger device set up, you need to go back to your trough
or ball drain device and add the new plunger to your trough's ``eject_targets:``,
like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #!    s_trough1:
   #!       number: 3-1
   #!    s_trough2:
   #!       number: 3-2
   #!    s_trough3:
   #!       number: 3-3
   #!    s_trough4:
   #!       number: 3-4
   #!    s_trough_jam:
   #!       number: 3-5
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   #!    c_trough_eject:
   #!       number: 2-2
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   ball_devices:
        bd_trough:
            ball_switches: s_trough1, s_trough2, s_trough3, s_trough4, s_trough_jam
            eject_coil: c_trough_eject
            tags: trough, home, drain
            jam_switch: s_trough_jam
            eject_coil_jam_pulse: 15ms
            eject_targets: bd_plunger
   #!      bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          eject_coil: c_plunger
   #!          mechanical_eject: true

Of course you'd add the name that you gave your plunger device, which could
be something like "bd_catapult" or whatever you called it.

Also, if you have a two-stage drain (like a System 11 machine), you'd add
this to the second device (the one that feeds the plunger).

8. Add the plunger as a default_source_device
---------------------------------------------

Next you need to add your plunger lane ball device ``default_source_device`` to
your playfield to tell MPF that this ball device is used to add a new ball
into play.

To do that, add your new plunger ball device as ``default_source_device`` in
the default ``playfield``, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! switches:
   #!    s_plunger_lane:
   #!       number: 2-6
   #! coils:
   #!    c_plunger:
   #!       number: 2-1
   #!       default_pulse_ms: 20
   #! ball_devices:
   #!      bd_plunger:
   #!          ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
   #!          eject_coil: c_plunger
   #!          mechanical_eject: true
   playfields:
       playfield:
           default_source_device: bd_plunger
           tags: default

9. Tag your playfield switches
------------------------------

Since the plunger lane ejects balls to the playfield, it's important that you
have your playfield switches tagged properly since that's how MPF knows that
a ball is loose on the playfield.

See the :doc:`/mechs/playfields/ball_tracking` documentation for details.

Complete config example
-----------------------

Here's a complete machine config with a "standard" coil-fired plunger that
ejects the ball directly to the playfield. Note that this config does not
include the switches and coils for the trough.

This config is what probably 99% of machines with coil-fired plungers will use:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
      s_plunger_lane:
         number: 2-6
      s_launch_button:
         number: 1-5
      s_trough1:
         number: 3-1
      s_trough2:
         number: 3-2
      s_trough3:
         number: 3-3
      s_trough4:
         number: 3-4
      s_trough_jam:
         number: 3-5

   coils:
        c_plunger:
            number: 2-1
            default_pulse_ms: 20
        c_trough_eject:
            number: 3-1
            default_pulse_ms: 20

   ball_devices:

        bd_trough:
            ball_switches: s_trough1, s_trough2, s_trough3, s_trough4, s_trough_jam
            eject_coil: c_trough_eject
            tags: trough, home, drain
            jam_switch: s_trough_jam
            eject_coil_jam_pulse: 15ms
            eject_targets: bd_plunger

        bd_plunger:
            ball_switches: s_plunger_lane
            eject_coil: c_plunger
            mechanical_eject: true
            player_controlled_eject_event: s_launch_button_active
            eject_timeouts: 3s

   playfields:
       playfield:
           default_source_device: bd_plunger
           tags: default
