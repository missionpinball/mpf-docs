Some machines have ramps which can be moved up and down.
Those mechanism typically act as a diverter and should be configured as such.

Hardware
--------

:doc:`TODO: Add a picture of a up-down ramp </about/help_us_to_write_it>`

Up-Down ramps either work with one coil or two coils.
Single-coil ramps use the coil to move the ramp up or down temporarily
Typically, they use a spring or gravity to move it back,
However, since the coil has to stay energized those ramps can only be active
for a short amount of time.
Two-coil ramps only pulse one coil to move the ramp up or down.
This poses the advantage that the ramp stays at one position without energizing
a coil.
However, this adds complexity (and a second coil) and is only used if the ramp
has to stay at both positions for extended periods of time.

Some part numbers:

 * Getaway: B-12576 assembly
 * RFM: A-22989
 * Apollo 13: #500-6044-00-44 assembly
 * Golden Eye: #515-6494-00

Config
------

Up-Down ramps are configured like a normal diverter:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   #! coils:
   #!    c_ramp1_up:
   #!       number:
   #!    c_ramp2_up:
   #!       number:
   #!    c_ramp2_down:
   #!       number:
   diverters:
        up_down_one_coil:
            activation_coil: c_ramp1_up
            type: hold
        up_down_two_coils:
            activation_coil: c_ramp2_up
            deactivation_coil: c_ramp2_down
            type: pulse
