Some hardware platforms support lamps in a matrix.
Those lights are usually bulbs and single color (white).
Each of them is assigned to a unique column/row combination and driven
sequentially by the platform.

Hardware
--------

:doc:`TODO: Add a picture of bulbs in a matrix </about/help_us_to_write_it>`

There are various types of bulbs in pinball machines depending on when they
were made.
In EM and early SS #44 and #47 bulbs were used.
Later SS machines used #555 bulbs (or the vibration resistant variant #444 or
the #259 substitute).
Those bulbs are rated at 6.3V but typically driven at 12V in a matrix or using
AC voltages in older machines.
Newer machines (pre LED) use #906 bulbs which are rated at 13.5V.

Config
------

Details differ by platform but the syntax for the number of such a light
is usually `column:row` or `column:row` (see your platform for details).
The config looks like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  lights:
    my_matrix_light:
      number: 2:10      # or 2/10

Monitorable Properties
----------------------

For :doc:`dynamic values </config/instructions/dynamic_values>` and
:doc:`conditional events </events/overview/conditional>`,
the prefix for LEDs is ``device.lights.<name>``.
