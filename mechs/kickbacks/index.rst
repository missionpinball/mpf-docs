A kickback mechanism is a type of :doc:`autofire coil </mechs/autofire_coils/index>`
that kicks the ball back into play, typically located in an outlane.
It is often paired with a :doc:`ball_save </config/ball_saves>` to compensate for
missed kickbacks.

:doc:`TODO: Add a picture of a kickback </about/help_us_to_write_it>`

This is an example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   switches:
       s_kickback:
           number: 5
   coils:
       c_kickback:
           number: 7
           default_pulse_ms: 15

   kickbacks:
       ac_kickback:
           coil: c_kickback
           switch: s_kickback

   ball_saves:
      kickback_ball_save:
        active_time: 5s
        enable_events: kickback_ac_kickback_fired
        auto_launch: yes
        balls_to_save: 1
