Choosing a computer to run MPF
==============================

Please make sure you read the  :doc:`Choosing a PC for MPF </hardware/computer/index>` section first.

In this section we talk about a potential production setup.
Thus, this is mostly about compromises.
What is the minimal (e.g. most cost effective) hardware?
You probably want to tune your game first.

Single-board versus "real" computers?
-------------------------------------

Picking an OS
-------------

The checklist
-------------

Now that you've read about all the background information that goes
into picking a host computer, let's break it down into the questions
you need to answer to pick the one that makes sense for you.

What OS are you familiar with?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More and more commercial machines are running Linux. But if you're
comfortable with Windows and you've never used Linux, then by all
means do not put a Linux computer in your pinball machine. It's just
not worth the headache. Sure, this might mean that you have to buy a
$150 motherboard/SSD/RAM/PSU combination versus a $50 single board
computer, but meh, that 100 bucks will be worth it in terms of future
pain avoided. And besides, pinball machines cost thousands of dollars
to build. What's another 100 bucks to make your life easier?

Do you have anything you can use now?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best host computer is the one that you already have. :) Seriously,
if you have something laying around, just start using it. You can
always change it out later. BTW, we've received a few questions from
people wanting to use Mac Minis.

Is this a one-off machine, or are you taking something into production?

What are your graphics and display requirements?

The Bottom Line
---------------

Remember that MPF and Python work identically regardless of whether
they're running on Windows, Mac, or Linux. So even if you pick the
"wrong" host computer now, you can always change it out later without
having to change any of your code or configuration files. So if you
have an old laptop sitting around then go ahead and use it for MPF.
You can always swap it out with a small single-board computer down the
road.
