A slide called (name) has just become active, meaning that it's now
showing as the current slide. This is useful for things like the
widget_player where you want to target a widget for a specific slide,
but you can only do so if that slide exists. Slide names do not take
into account what display they're playing on, so be sure to create
machine-wide unique names when you're naming your slides.
