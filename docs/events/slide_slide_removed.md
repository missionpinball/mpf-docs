# slide_(name)\_removed


*MPF-MC Event*

Event is posted by [slides:](../config/slides.md)

*MPF-GMC Event*

Event is posted by [GMC slides](../gmc/reference/mpf-slide.md)

A slide called (name) has just been removed.

This event is posted whenever a slide is removed, regardless of whether
or not that slide was active (showing).

Note that even though this event is called "removed", it's actually
posted as part of the removal process. (e.g. there are still some
clean-up things that happen afterwards.)

Slide names do not take into account what display or slide frame
they're playing on, so be sure to create machine-wide unique names when
you're naming your slides.
