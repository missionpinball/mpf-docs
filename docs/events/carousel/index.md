# Carousel Events

These events are posted by the built-in Carousel mode.

See: [Carousel Mode Selection](../../cookbook/carousel.md) for pre-0.80 carousel configuration.

See: [MPFCarousel](../../gmc/reference/mpf-carousel.md) for 0.80+ carousel configuration.

The following events are as of MPF `0.80.0.dev10`.
Previously, the word "carousel" was replaced with the actual carousel name, along with other differences.

* [carousel_item_highlighted](../carousel_item_highlighted.md)
* [carousel\_items_empty](../carousel_items_empty.md)
* [carousel\_item_selected](../carousel_item_selected.md)
