# (carousel_name)\_item_empty


--8<-- "event.md"

The carousel named (carousel_name) determined that it has
no selectable_items that are valid for display. This can be because
the `mode_settings` for the carousel mode still needs to be set,
or because all of the `selectable_items` were dynamically evaluated
and removed from the valid option set.
