# slide_(name)\_inactive


*MPF-GMC Event*

Event is posted by [GMC slides](../gmc/reference/mpf-slide.md)

A slide called (name) has just become inactive, meaning that it's no
longer showing as the current slide. Slide names do not take
into account what display they're playing on, so be sure to create
machine-wide unique names when you're naming your slides.
