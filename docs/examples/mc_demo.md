# How to run the "MC Demo" example


The [MPF Examples](mpf-examples.md) GitHub
repository includes a machine configuration called "MC Demo" which is
a demo of many different features of the MPF media controller. Here are
a few random screen shots of it:

You can run it and use the arrow keys on your computer to step through
different slides, and then you can look at the source config file to see
how it all works.

It's designed to both show you what's possible and to show you how to
do different things with the MC.

## 1. Download the MPF examples bundle

Instructions [here](mpf-examples.md). (Make sure you get the one that matches the version of MPF you're using. The 'dev' branch is MPF 0.57, so if you're on 0.56 or earlier, select the proper branch to download.)

## 2. Run it

Open a command prompt or terminal window, and change to the "mc_demo"
folder in the "mpf-examples" package you downloaded. Then run:

    mpf both

When you run the demo, use the left and right arrow keys to step through
the different slides.

## 3. Check out the config (with notes!)

You can browse the complete config in the `mc_demo/config/config.yaml`
file. Or check it out online
[here](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-examples/blob/dev/mc_demo/config/config.yaml).
