# Interactive MC (iMC)


The MPF MC package includes an "interactive" MC which you can use to
live-edit YAML configurations for slides and widgets and see the results
in realtime in your on-screen window.

Running the iMC does two things:

1.  It launches the MC like normal, loading your game's config files.
2.  It launches a second window which has a multi-line editable text box
    where you can type or paste slide configs.

The idea is you can use the iMC to keep tweaking and fine-tuning your
slide and widget settings in a way that's much easier than starting
your game and going through your game to find the slide you're looking
for.

!!! note

    The iMC does not connect to physical hardware, so if you have a physical
    DMD then you will have to test with an on-screen virtual DMD.

Since the iMC uses the regular MC and the regular config files, you have
access to all the named widgets, images, videos, widget styles, fonts,
etc. from your machine config.

See [mpf imc command](../running/commands/imc.md).
