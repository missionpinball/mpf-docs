# MPF Versions


MPF is a work-in-progress. New versions are released every so often. You
can find your MPF version by running [mpf --version](#) from
the command line.

If you're looking for a specific version of the documentation to match
the older version of MPF you're using, look in the "Assets" link at
the bottom of the release notes for any version in the [MPF releases
page on GitHub](https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/releases).

* [Docs for older MPF versions](docs.md)
* [Understanding MPF version numbering](understanding.md)
* [Release notes](release_notes.md)
* [Roadmap & future pinball vision](roadmap.md)
* [MPF release checklist](release_checklist.md)
