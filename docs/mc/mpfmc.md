# The MPF Media Controller

--8<-- "mpf-mc.md"

Like MPF, the MPF-MC is also written in Python, using a Python-based
multimedia framework called [Kivy](http://kivy.org). Kivy is a wrapper
for the native graphics & sound libraries on your computer, and it
leverages the latest technologies including SDL2, Gstreamer, and OpenGL.

All of the tutorials and installation guides included in this
documentation explain how to install and use the MPF-MC, so there's
really nothing to know about it other than it's probably the one
you're using.
