# Creating your own modes


Our step-by-step tutorial walks you through creating your own game
modes. We just include this page on creating your own modes so you
don't read the list of built-in modes and think that's all MPF can do.
:)

Also if you haven't read the overview of
[how modes work in MPF](../../index.md), do that
now. We documented the general approach to design a game in the
[Game Design](../../game_design/index.md)
section.
