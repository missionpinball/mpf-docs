`class mpf.devices.achievement.Achievement(*args, **kwargs)`

Bases: mpf.core.mode_device.ModeDevice

An achievement in a pinball machine. It is tracked per player and can automatically restore state on the next ball.

## Accessing achievements in code

The device collection which contains the achievements in your machine is available via `self.machine.achievements`. For example, to access one called “foo”, you would use `self.machine.achievements.foo`. You can also access achievements in dictionary form, e.g. `self.machine.achievements['foo']`. You can also get devices by tag or hardware number. See the DeviceCollection documentation for details.
