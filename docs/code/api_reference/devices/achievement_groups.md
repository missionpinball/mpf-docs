`class mpf.devices.achievement_group.AchievementGroup(*args, **kwargs)`

Bases: mpf.core.mode_device.ModeDevice

An achievement group in a pinball machine. It is tracked per player and can automatically restore state on the next ball.

## Accessing achievement_groups in code

The device collection which contains the achievement_groups in your machine is available via `self.machine.achievement_groups`. For example, to access one called “foo”, you would use `self.machine.achievement_groups.foo`. You can also access `achievement_groups` in dictionary form, e.g. `self.machine.achievement_groups['foo']`.  You can also get devices by tag or hardware number. See the DeviceCollection documentation for details.
