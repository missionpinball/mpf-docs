Bases: mpf.core.system_wide_device.SystemWideDevice

Hardware sound system using in EM and SS machines.

## Accessing hardware_sound_systems in code

The device collection which contains the `hardware_sound_systems` in your machine is available via `self.machine.hardware_sound_systems`. For example, to access one called “foo”, you would use `self.machine.hardware_sound_systems.foo`. You can also access hardware_sound_systems in dictionary form, e.g. `self.machine.hardware_sound_systems['foo']`. You can also get devices by tag or hardware number. See the DeviceCollection documentation for details.
