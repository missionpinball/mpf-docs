# self.machine.steppers.*

`class mpf.devices.stepper.Stepper(*args, **kwargs)`

Bases: mpf.core.system_wide_device.SystemWideDevice

Represents an stepper motor based axis in a pinball machine.

Args: Same as the Device parent class.

## Accessing steppers in code

The device collection which contains the steppers in your machine is available via `self.machine.steppers`. For example, to access one called “foo”, you would use `self.machine.steppers.foo`. You can also access steppers in dictionary form, e.g. `self.machine.steppers['foo']`.

You can also get devices by tag or hardware number. See the DeviceCollection documentation for details.
