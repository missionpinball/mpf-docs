# hello (BCP command)
This is the initial handshake command upon first connection. It sends the BCP protocol version that the origin controller speaks.

## Origin
Pin controller or media controller

## Parameters
### version
Type: `string`

The BCP communication specification version implemented in the controller (ex: 1.0).

### controller_name
Type: `string`

The name of the controller (ex: Mission Pinball Framework).

### controller_version
Type: `string`

The version of the controller (ex: 0.33.0).

## Response

When received by the media controller, this command automatically triggers a hard “reset”. If the pin controller is sending this command, the media controller will respond with either its own “hello” command, or the error “unknown protocol version.” The pin controller should never respond to this command when it receives it from the media controller; that would trigger an infinite loop.
