# trigger (BCP command)
This command allows the one side to trigger the other side to do something. For example, the pin controller might send trigger commands to tell the media controller to start shows, play sound effects, or update the display. The media controller might send a trigger to the pin controller to flash the strobes at the down beat of a music track or to pulse the knocker in concert with a replay show.
