# machine_variable (BCP command)
This is a generic “catch all” which sends machine variables to the media controller any time they change. Machine variables are like player variables, except they’re maintained machine-wide instead of per-player or per-game. Since the pin controller will most likely track hundreds of variables (with many being internal things that the media controller doesn’t care about), it’ s recommended that the pin controller has a way to filter which machine variables are sent to the media controller.

## Origin
Pin controller

## Parameters
### name
Type: `string`

This is the name of the machine variable.

### value
Type: Varies depending upon the variable type.

This is the new value of the machine variable.

### prev_value
Type: Varies depending upon the variable type.

This is the previous value of the machine variable.

### change
Type: Varies depending upon the variable type.

If the machine variable just changed, this will be the amount of the change. If it’s not possible to determine a numeric change (for example, if this machine variable is a string), then this change value will be set to the boolean True.

## Response
None
