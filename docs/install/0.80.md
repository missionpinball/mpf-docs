# MPF 0.80 changes (GMC pre-release)

*Last updated May 25, 2024*

The upcoming release of MPF is 0.80, which includes support for the Godot Media Controller (GMC) and drops support for the 0.57 Kivy-based Media Controller (MC).

While there are not many functional changes in MPF between 0.57 and 0.80, there are some config file migrations necessary and this document will help you through that.

## List of Required Changes

### Bonus

The bonus config spec has changed to use the keyword `entry` instead of `event` when defining bonus entries, because Bonus events have changed to use a consolidated *bonus_entry* event instead of unique events for each bonus item (including subtotal, multiplier, and total).

In your bonus.yaml config section, change each entry from `event: bonus_item_name` to `entry: bonus_item_name`.

With this change, given a bonus entry named "completed_ramps" that was hit 3 times for a score of 3000:

**MPF 0.57 Event:**
``` console
completed_ramps{hits=3, score=3000}
```

**MPF 0.80 Event:**
``` console
bonus_entry{entry="completed_ramps", hits=3, score=3000}
```


### Carousel

Carousel events have changed to use a consolidated *carousel_item_highlighted* and *carousel_item_selected* event instead of unique events for each item.

Given a carousel mode "missionselect" and an item "garrus":

**MPF 0.57 Event:**
``` console
missionselect_garrus_highlighted{direction="forwards"}
```

**MPF 0.80 Event:**
``` console
carousel_item_highlighted{carousel="missionselect", item="garrus", direction="forwards"}
```

The new *carousel_item_highlighted* event is incorporated into GMC, but if you have other custom event handlers for carousel item selection those will need to be updated.

### Slides and Widgets

The GMC manages all slides and widgets, so the `slides:` and `widgets:` config sections are deprecated.

### Sound Player

The GMC manages all sound assets, so the `sound_system:` and `sounds:` config sections are deprecated. You can still reference sounds by filename directly, but if you want to specify specific settings for a sound or sound pool, use the `MPFSoundAsset` resource type in GMC.

Audio channel groups have been renamed from "tracks" to "buses", so in your `sound_player:` config sections change `track: music` to `bus: music`.

### Sound Pools

The GMC includes support for sound pools using the `AudioStreamRandomizer` resource type. You can combine this sound pool with MPF-specific sound properties by creating an `MPFSoundAsset` resource and using an `AudioStreamRandomizer` as the stream.

!!! warning "Using MPF Sound Pools"

    If you have a large project with many `sound_pools:` defined in MPF configs, it is *possible* to continue using them until you migrate them to GMC. This hack is not officially supported, and may have unintended side-effects, so use with caution.

    To enable sound pools in config files, you will need to install the legacy MPF-MC in your virtual environment with `pip install mpf-mc`. This will cause the MC to inject the sound pool configurations into MPF 0.80

    **Note:** While MPF will manage the sound pools, it will not be able to map sound pool sound names to files configured in a `sounds:` config section (which is no longer supported). Your sound pools ***must** use the name of the sound file as the sound name or GMC will not be able to find the correct file.
