!!! note

    This section can also be used in a show file in the `segment_displays:`
    section of a step.

The `segment_display_player:` section of your config is a
[Config Players](../config_players/index.md) which controls
[/hardware/segment_display_platforms](segment_displays.md). See
[Alpha-Numeric / Segment Displays](../mc/displays/alpha_numeric.md) for
details.

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `segment_display_player:`
section of your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be
used).

### action:

Single value, type: one of the following options: add, remove, flash,
no_flash, flash_match, flash_mask, set_color. Default: `add`

* `add` - Add a text to the segment_display.
* `remove` - Remove a text from the segment_display by key. If a
    `transition_out:` setting is used, then that transition will be
    started.
* `no_flash` - Stop flashing this segment display.
* `flash` - Flash this segment display.
* `flash_match` - Flash the last two characters of the segment
    display.
* `flash_mask` - Use the `flash_mask` parameter value to determine
    which characters of the segment display to flash.
* `set_color` - Set the color(s) of the characters in the segment
    display (for platforms that support it).

### color:

List of one (or more) values, each is a type: `color` (*color name*,
*hex*, or list of values *0*-*255*). Defaults to empty.

The color for each character in the display (if the platform supports
it). If a single color is supplied, all characters in the display will
be set to that color. See
[Specifying Colors in Config Files](instructions/colors.md) for more
information on specifying colors in config files.

### expire:

Single value, type: ms_or_token. Defaults to empty.

Only used with `action` `add`. Text will be removed after `expire` ms.

### flash_mask:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

Only used with the `flash_mask` action (or with `add` when the
`flashing` parameter is set to `mask`. Determines which characters of
the segment display will be flashed. Each character of the flash mask
string represents a character in the display. Character positions with
an `F` character (must be upper-case) will be flashed while positions
containing any other character will not flash. For example, in a segment
display of length 16, to flash the first 8 characters use a `flash_mask`
parameter value of `FFFFFFFF________`. You can use whatever character
you wish for the non-flashing character positions.

### flashing:

Single value, type: one of the following options: off, all, match, mask,
not_set. Default: `not_set`

* `off` - Stop flashing this segment display.
* `all` - Flash all characters in this segment display.
* `match` - Flash the last two characters of the segment display.
* `mask` - Use the `flash_mask` parameter value to determine which
    characters of the segment display to flash.

Only used with the `add` action.

### key:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

Key to use with `action` `add` and `remove` to reference a text on the
segment display. Only relevant if [segment_displays](segment_displays.md) `update_method` is `stack`, not being
used if `replace` is used.

### priority:

Single value, type: int_or_token. Default: `0`

Priority of this text. The segment display will maintain a stack and
show the text on top (highest priority). Only relevant if [segment_displays](segment_displays.md) `update_method` is `stack`, not being
used if `replace` is used.

### text:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

Text to show. You can use [Text Templates](instructions/text_templates.md).
To erase the text on a display simply send an empty string "".

### transition:

Note, that if you have set a duration in a show, that this duration **in**cludes the time for the incoming transition.

!!! note

    Be sure the `segment_display` `size` parameter has been properly set for
    the segment display or the transition effects may not be calculated and
    displayed properly.

Example:

``` mpf-config
#! segment_displays:
#!   display1:
#!     number: 1
segment_display_player:
  jackpot_completed:
    display1:
      text: JACKPOT
      priority: 1000
      expire: 2s
      transition:
        type: push
        direction: right
        text: " *** "
      transition_out:
        type: push
        direction: right
        text: " *** "
```

#### type

The type of animation to be used.

* push
* cover
* uncover
* split
* wipe

#### direction

The direction of the animation, for type `push`, `cover`, `uncover` and `wipe` value can be either `left` or `right` (default). For split the value can be `in` or `out` (default).

#### text

_Additonal_ text used in animation, if not set only the show text will be used.


### transition_out:

Note, that if you have set a duration in a show, that this duration **ex**cludes the time for the outgoing transition. For anything else see above on the `transition` section.

There can only be one transition between text entries, so if outgoing
text has a `transition_out` set, and an incoming text entry has a
`transition` set, then the incoming transition will take precedence.
