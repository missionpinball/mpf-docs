# Understanding the debug: setting


Almost every device and platform in MPF contains a `debug` setting. If
you set this to `True` MPF will generate more log output for this
device. This may greatly increase the log size and decrease performance.
Enable it if you got problems with a certain device or platform to debug
problems later on.
