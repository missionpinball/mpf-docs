# Case insensitivity in config files


Setting names config files are case sensitive (starting with 0.50). In
0.17 to 0.33 settings were case insensitive but it caused many problems
and thus has been dropped. Generally, a safe approach is to use only
lower case in config files, though, it is fine to use upper case in
slides. Using lower case is recommended for naming modes, devices,
timers, etc....
