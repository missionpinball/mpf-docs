A "light_rings" will create "count" lights for you starting the
number at "number_start". If you need a prefix or suffix for the
number you can use "number_template". All settings in
"light_template" will be applied to all lights. The only difference
between [light_stripes](light_stripes.md) and [light_rings](light_rings.md) is how the x/y coordinates are computed.

## Required settings

The following sections are required in the `light_rings:` section of
your config:

### count:

Single value, type: `integer`. Defaults to empty.

The integer value for how many LEDs are in the ring.

### light_template:

Single value, type: [lights:](lights.md).
Defaults to empty.

This is a list of sub-settings (indented) that are regular settings from
the [lights](lights.md) section of your machine
config. Any settings that are valid there are valid here, and they're
applied to all the LEDs in the ring.

## Optional settings

The following sections are optional in the `light_rings:` section of
your config. (If you don't include them, the default will be used).

### center_x:

Single value, type: `number` (will be converted to floating point).
Defaults to empty.

The "x" position of the center of the ring. (This is not used in MPF
yet.)

### center_y:

Single value, type: `number` (will be converted to floating point).
Defaults to empty.

The "y" position of the center of the ring.

### number_start:

Single value, type: `integer`. Default: `0`

The integer value for the number for the first LED in the ring. (MPF
assumes that all the LEDs in the ring are numbered sequentially.)

### number_template:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

MPF automatically configures the LEDs in a ring. The first one uses the
`number_start:` value, and then it counts up from there up through the
`count:` value.

However, many hardware numbers for LEDs are not just vanilla numbers,
rather they also include a board number or channel or something like
that. The `number_template:` is where you specify what that number value
looks like. Just use braces `{}` for the part you want replaced by a
number.

The example config with a number template of `7-{}` with a number start
of 200 and a count of 5 will create 5 LEDs with the numbers 7-200,
7-201, 7-202, 7-203, and 7-204.

### previous:

Single value, type: `string` name of a [lights:](lights.md) device. Defaults to empty.

### radius:

Single value, type: `number` (will be converted to floating point).
Defaults to empty.

The radius of the ring (in relative size to the x/y coordinates of the
`center_x:` and `center_y:` positions. This is used for the calculation
of x/y positions of individual LEDs only.

### start_angle:

Single value, type: `number` (will be converted to floating point).
Default: `0`

The angle (in degrees, 0-360) of the first LED in the right. This is
used for the calculation of x/y positions of individual LEDs only.

### start_channel:

Single value, type: `string`. Defaults to empty.

This setting can be used to override the start channel if necessary.

### console_log:

Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full.
Default: `basic`

Log level for the console log for this device.

### debug:

Single value, type: `boolean` (`true`/`false`). Default: `false`

Set this to true to see additional debug output. This might impact the
performance of MPF.

### file_log:

Single value, type: one of the following options: none, basic, full.
Default: `basic`

Log level for the file log for this device.

### label:

Single value, type: `string`. Default: `%`

Name of this device in service mode.

### tags:

List of one (or more) values, each is a type: `string`. Defaults to
empty.

Not used.
