extra_ball_(name)_awarded
=========================

*MPF player variable*

The number of times this extra ball has been awarded to the
player in this game. Note that the default max is one (meaning that
each extra ball can be awarded once per game), so this value will only
be 0 or 1 unless you change the max setting for this extra ball.
