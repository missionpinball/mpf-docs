YAML error on first start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You might see this error on startup when installing/upgrading to 0.53/dev from an older version:

.. code-block:: doscon

   pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (ruamel.yaml 0.15.37 (c:\users\robert\appdata\local\programs\python\python36\lib\site-packages), Requirement.parse('ruamel.yaml<0.11,>=0.10')

What happened? You probably got incompatible versions of MPF, MPF-MC and/or the MPF-Monitor installed.
We used to install ruamel 0.11 and switches to 0.15 in MPF 0.53+.
MPF cannot start with two yaml libraries.
To fix this check your versions ``pip3 list`` and check ``mpf``, ``mpf-mc`` and ``mpf-monitor``.
Remove the wrong version and install the right one.
All versions need to match (for instance all 0.53 or all dev).

The following command will remove all three and install the latest release:

.. code-block:: doscon

   pip3 uninstall mpf mpf-mc mpf-monitor
   pip3 install mpf mpf-mc mpf-monitor
