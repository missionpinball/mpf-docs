Installing MPF on a Pine64 with Ubuntu
======================================

.. note::

   This procedure for installing MPF on a Pine64 does not fully work. (MPF runs
   fine, Kivy installs fine, but MPF-MC does not run.) If you want to use MPF
   on a Pine64, maybe you can help figure out why this doesn't work and share
   your findings with us?)

Hardware Notes
--------------

* Spring for the fastest MicroSD card you can (Samsung Evo cards are reportedly
  the fastest), at least 16GB.
* The Pine64’s video seems to only support 1080p and 4K resolutions, so make
  sure your display can do one or both of those at a proper 16:9 aspect ratio
  or else everything will be scaled and squished and it looks awful.
* If you find that your pine64 does not boot it maybe due to using a HDMI->DVI
  cable, try HDMI to HDMI first.


System Notes
------------

There are a bunch of things that arrive broken with the current Ubuntu
installer for Pine64 (as of this writing in November 2016). Some of them will
prevent MPF from installing, and a few are just annoying.

Instructions
------------

After installing the OS following the instructions on the
`Pine64 Wiki <http://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/Main_Page)>`_, expanding the
volume to the full size of the SD card, and getting connected to the Internet,
follow these steps. Don't try to update the installed system before following
this.

Locale
------

Locale arrives broken and this wreaks all kinds of havoc, so here's how to fix
it.

Assuming you want US English, substitute your preferred language if not:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo locale-gen "en_US.UTF-8"
   Generating locales...
     en_US.UTF-8... done
   Generation complete.

   $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
   Generating locales...
     en_US.UTF-8... up-to-date
   Generation complete.

That command will open a text-based dialog, we recommend that you don’t choose
“ALL” and only select the one or a few languages you want (generating them all
takes a long time). Then reboot, then do the above reconfigure step AGAIN, then
reboot, then run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ locale

And make sure it looks good. Mine says:

.. code-block:: console

   LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   LANGUAGE=en
   LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
   LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
   LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
   LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_NAME=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_ADDRESS=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_TELEPHONE=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_IDENTIFICATION=en_US.UTF-8
   LC_ALL=

It took a few tries for this to stick for me, so do it again, including reboot,
if your results here are wrong.

Fix the Software Boutique
-------------------------

This arrives broken, too. Oddly, running the Mate Welcome as root and clicking
a button partly fixes it.

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo ubuntu-mate-welcome

When it comes up, click on the "Subscribe to updates" button, then quit it.

Now go to System -> Administration -> Software Boutique. Click on the wrench,
then do each repair option (after clicking one, wait for it to say it has
finished).

Now go to System -> Administration -> Software Updater and get everything up to
date. You will need to reboot again
after that.

Install Missing pip3
--------------------

.. code-block:: console

   $ apt-get install python3-pip

The path where ``pip`` puts executables is not in the system default path, so
edit ``~/.bashrc`` to add the following path:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo nano ~/.bashrc

At the bottom of the file add the following:

.. code-block:: console

   export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH

Hit "control + x" to save and "y" then "return" to save the file as the same
name.

Now start a fresh terminal so that this new PATH is included in your current
environment. Then:

Install MPF
-----------

Download the MPF Debian Installer from
https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-debian-installer/archive/v0.30.zip

(This is for MPF versions 0.30 and newer)

To unzip the file navigate in your terminal to the location of the downloaded
files.

Unzip the file:

.. code-block:: console

   $ unzip v0.30.zip .

If this does not run you may need to install unzip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo apt-get install unzip

After unzip, run ./mpf-debian-installer-0.30/install from the folder you
unzipped the files to. Consult the README for more information.

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip3 install mpf-mc

Running MPF
-----------

See the :doc:`/running/index` page for details and command-line options.
