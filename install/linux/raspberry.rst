Installing MPF on a Raspberry Pi 3
==================================

.. warning::

   Raspberry Pi support is experimental at this point. Users have found various issues with audio, and we're not sure
   whether the RPi has enough power to support MPF. So this document is more like a collection of notes versus a solid
   guide. We welcome your feedback or experience with other low-cost systems, though at this point if you're looking for
   a development platform, we'd probably recommend buying a more beefy x86 computer. For a "final" machine an
   inexpensive (<$200) Intel-based system running Linux or Windows might be better suited. However, it should be
   possible to run your final game on a RPi3 if you tune your game accordingly. For example, this would include
   transcoding your videos to a format which can be played hardware accelerated on the RPi.


One first word:
Don't try to install mpf on a Raspberry Pi B+ or Raspberry zero, it just won't work or will be very slow.
Get yourself at a Raspberry Pi 3, they have a quad-core processor running with more than 900MHz. RPi3 also has better
audio than RPi 1 (still not perfect). An HDMI audio adapter may be worthy for better audio.

One nice thing we will have afterwards is a low-cost PC which will run fast enough for mpf-mc with audio, video,
antialiazing and touchscreen support.

Let's start:

- get the latest Kivypie version (a minimal version without X-Server but preinstalled kivy) here:
  http://kivypie.mitako.eu/kivy-download.html
  Many Kudos to Albert Casals and their group, since normally its a pain to install kivy on a raspberry (compiling lasts
  forever).

- Unzip the image (do not copy .zip file to your SD card).

- depending on your development os use Win32 Diskimager, dd, Imagewriter... to write your image to the sd-card (use at
  least an 8 GB Card). You can find Instructions here:
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

- insert the sd-card into your pi and boot it up (first boot does take some time since it sets some os specific
  parameters)

- login with user:sysop password:posys. You can do this either via network or a serial port.

- now type this:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo raspi-config

and choose 7. Advanced Options -> A1. Expand Filesystem to use the whole SD-Card Space, we will need it.
You can change your username and localization settings too.

After that we will give the GPU a bit more of RAM:

Go to 7. Advanced Options -> A3 Memory split
and change the value to 256.

Now reboot, login and type:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt-get update

to update the debian repositories links.

The standard /tmp "folder" is too small on pipaos, just type:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo umount /tmp

to get rid of it. (It will be created automatically if needed and will have the whole space afterwards)

Now run the :doc:`MPF Linux Debian installer </install/linux/index>`. It will install MPF, MPF-MC and all dependencies for
you.

This will take some time as it may compile some drivers mpf-mc needs like the audio driver.
Sometimes it looks like it hangs, but it does not. It will take up to half an hour, at least on a Raspberry 1 (which
you should not use). Compiling is really slow on the Raspi.

Now copy your machine folder from your develop station or create a new one under your home directory
(/home/sysop/your_machine)

If you need a file-manager start mc (No, not the mpf mediacontroller, its the midnight commander ;-))

If you need to copy your folders from an usb-stick you have to manually mount it (we dont have X, so everything has to
be done by hand).

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt

This works in 90% otherwise your stick is not sda1, just look inside the /dev folder to find out which device you have
to mount or type

.. code-block:: shell

    lsblk

to list your block devices.

Now you find the contents of your stick in /mnt.

To tell mpf-mc and the underlying kivy to use the framebuffer via SDL2 you have to put this in your
machine/config/config.yaml:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  window:
    width: 1280
    height: 800

  kivy_config:
    graphics:
      fbo: force-hardware

More or less important last steps:
----------------------------------

Serial communication:
---------------------
Linux always had and has the possibility to log in via a serial connection.
If you run a hardware platform which uses the serial pin on the Raspberry
you should disable the Linux login shell on that port.
The device is called /dev/ttyAMA0 and you need to stop it from starting:

Type:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service

Now you have to disable the console itself:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo mc

to start Midnight Commander as root (normally you should not do this, but this time you have to.)

Now go to /boot and press F4 over cmdline.txt.

Remove these entries:

::

  console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0, 115200

and save the file.

You have the possibility to connect RS 232 devices directly to the raspi but take care, the voltage levels are 3.3V on
the raspi gpio.

Sound output:
-------------

Navigate to /boot/config.txt if you want to use audio out of the Raspberry built in ""soundcard"":
edit this file as root and insert this line:

::

  dtparam=audio=on

Inside this file you can change some settings that initialize on boot, its like a bios which the raspberry does not have.

Video Playback:
---------------
If you need video capability in your mpf-mc you need to install one player that kivy will use to play your videos:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo apt-get install omxplayer

You can try videoplayback with

.. code-block:: shell

  omxplayer your_video.mp4

To test the video playback capability under kivy into the framebuffer just run this command:

.. code-block:: shell

  python3 -m kivy.uix.videoplayer /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/mpfmc/tests/machine_files/video/videos/mpf_video_small_test.mp4


Troubleshooting:
----------------

More documentation about kivypie can be found here: http://kivypie.mitako.eu/kivy-faq.html

No sound:
---------
If you have trouble getting sound out of your speakers or monitor have a look here:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/audio-config.md

If sound plays via omxplayer but not in MPF, set use_sdl_mixer_loader: False in your MPF configuration file.

Do a reboot:
------------

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo reboot

Remote log in:
--------------
To log in from your development machine into your raspberry you can do it easily via ssh.
For windows I recommend putty:
http://www.putty.org/

See whats going on on your pinball:
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo dispman_vncserver

This starts a vncserver on your raspi and you can log in remotely from a RealVNCViewer
https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/

Kivypie IP address, port 5900. It is not 100% reliable but fairly usable. Thanks to Peter Hanzel.

Start mpf and mpf-mc
--------------------

To test your installation type

.. code-block:: shell

  mpf

in your machine_folder.

Press (STRG+ALT F2) to change to the second terminal tty2.

Login and start mpf-mc inside your machine folder with

.. code-block:: shell

  mpf mc

Enjoy!
