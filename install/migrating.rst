Migrating from older versions of MPF
====================================

Upgrading MPF to the latest version
-----------------------------------
This is covered in the relevant install sections:

 * Linux: `<linux.html#keeping-mpf-up-to-date>`_
 * Windows: `<windows.html#keeping-mpf-up-to-date>`_
 * Mac: `<mac.html#keeping-mpf-up-to-date>`_

If you are upgrading from 0.21 (or earlier) you need to install Python 3 (as explained in the installation section for your platform).

Migrate your config
-------------------
A migrator exists for config version 3 (0.21 and earlier) to 4 (0.30 to 0.33). There is no automated migrator from
version 4 to 5 (0.33 to 0.50).  Instead, there is a :doc:`migration guide </install/migrate4to5>`
to make the necessary changes manually. If you encounter any problems during migration feel free to ask in the forum.
