Show configuration format
=========================
Shows are defined via nested key/value pairs in YAML files.

A show contains multiple steps, and each step contains a time (for when that step should run) and instructions (for
what actions should happen in that step).

Here is a very simple show with two steps. The first step sets the color of
*led1* to *red*, then one second later, it turns *led1* off again. Then after
another second, the show is over. (Most likely you'd configure a show like this
to *loop*, meaning this should could be used to flash *led1* on and off.)

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: 0
     lights:
       led1: red
   - time: +1
     lights:
       led1: off
   - time: +1

There are :doc:`lots of different actions you can configure in a show step </config_players/index>` (LEDs, lights,
sounds, coils, display slides, etc.), but for now we'll just use this very simple show as an example.

Defining steps
--------------
Shows are configured via YAML-like format, just like config files.

In the example show above, note that each *step* in the show starts with a key/value pair that's separated with a
dash, then a space. So you could say that the example show above has three steps:

Step 1:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: 0
     lights:
       led1: red

Step 2:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: +1
     lights:
       led1: off

Step 3:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: +1

.. important:: YAML formatting can be tricky. It's important that you include a
   space between the dash and the key name. ``-time: 0`` will not work and give
   you an error (since there is no space between ``-`` and ``time``.). Also,
   make sure the individual setting names are all aligned vertically.
   (In the example above, *time:* and *lights:*) are left-aligned.

Setting step time
-----------------
The ``time:`` setting in each step represents the time when that step *starts*. The first
step will always be ``time: 0``

If you just enter a number for the *time*, that number represents seconds.
However, you can enter the time in :doc:`standard MPF time format </config/instructions/time_strings>`,
which could be *ms*, *secs*, etc. The following are all valid *time* entries:

* ``time: 1`` (1 second)
* ``time: 1.0`` (1 second)
* ``time: 1s`` (1 second)
* ``time: 1000ms`` (1 second)

If you do not enter a ``time:`` setting for a step, MPF automatically uses ``time: +1``.

When shows are played, it's possible to specify a *speed* setting which is a
multiplier for how fast the show is played. The default is ``1.0`` which would
use the time values entered here, but keep in mind that it's possible to play a
show back at any speed. You can even change the speed of a running show while it's
in progress.

.. tip:: The precision of shows is limited to clock speed that MPF runs at. By
   default, MPF runs at 60fps, which means that each "tick" of MPF is about
   16ms. So in that case, you can't get resolution of shows more precise than
   that.

Absolute time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The time value for each step indicates when this step will play measured in
time since the start of the show. This is useful if you're synchronizing show
steps with sound or video.

Relative time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes it's more convenient to specify the timing of a step in a show
relative to the step before it. To do that, enter the *time* value with a + in
front of it, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: +1

Relative step times are nice because you can adjust the timing of one step and
then all the other relative steps after it are shifted back or forwards
automatically.

You can mix-and-match incremental and absolute times in the same show,
and you can also combine the plus sign for relative times with seconds or
millisecond values. For example:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  ##! show: my_show
  - time: 0   # plays right away, at 0 seconds
    # ...
  - time: +1  # plays 1 sec after the previous, 1 sec after show start
    # ...
  - time: +1  # plays 1 sec after the previous, 2 secs after show start
    # ...
  - time: 4   # plays 4 secs after show start, 2 secs after the previous
    # ...
  - time: +1  # plays 1 sec after the previous, 5 secs after show start
    #...

Note that since shows use YAML formatting, you can use the hash sign (``#``) to
add comments which MPF ignores.

Setting step duration
---------------------

Instead of specifying the "time" when a step starts, you can also specify the "duration" of how long a step lasts (which
is essentially specifying when a step ends). The difference is subtle, but each is useful in different situations.

For example, the following to shows are identical:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: 0
     lights:
       led1: red
   - time: +1
     lights:
       led1: off
   - time: +1

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - duration: 1
     lights:
       led1: red
   - duration: 1
     lights:
       led1: off

You can also mix and match "time" and "duration" settings in the same show (and even in the same step). The only thing
you can't do is have a "time" setting in a step that follows a step with "duration" (since those two values would
essentially mean the same thing and it would be confusing).

Setting the duration of the final step
--------------------------------------
Most people find it easiest to just use either "time" or "duration" consistently throughout a show. The only practical
difference you need to think about is how the final step works.

For example, with "time"-based steps, you're specifying the time when a step starts. So when does a step stop? When the
next one starts. But what about your last step in the show? How long should it run for? If you just use time-based
steps, you'd still want to specify a "duration" for the final step, like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: 0
     lights:
       led1: red
   - time: +1
     lights:
       led1: green
   - time: +1
     duration: 1
     lights:
       led1: blue

"Holding" the final step
------------------------

You can set a ``duration: -1`` for an "infinite" duration of a step. (Think of this like a hold or pause.) This is most
useful in shows that you want to run and then hold something in their final state. For example, maybe you want a show
that runs once (no loop) and flashes a light which then stays on. You could do that like this:

.. code-block:: mpf-config

   ##! show: my_show
   - time: 0
     lights:
       led1: red
   - time: +250ms
     lights:
       led1: off
   - time: +250ms
     lights:
       led1: red
   - time: +250ms
     lights:
       led1: off
   - time: +250ms
     lights:
       led1: red
     duration: -1

In this example, the LED would stay on (red) until that show was manually stopped or until the mode was stopped (if the
``show_player:`` entry was in a mode config file).
