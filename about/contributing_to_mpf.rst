Contributing to MPF

might be useful for other users? Fixed a bug? Added some small missing piece?

We'd love to take your contribution upstream!

Found a bug which you can reproduce? Fill an issue:

* `MPF Issues on github <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/issues>`_. Use
  this for game and platform related bugs

Install MPF in development mode
-------------------------------

To work on MPF you need to install it in developer/editable mode:

#. Fork the `mpf repo <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/>`_ on GitHub.
#. Fork the `mpf-mc repo <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf-mc/>`_ on GitHub
   (only needed for media controller changes - skip otherwise).
#. Clone your fork of the mpf repo to your local machine (``git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/mpf/``)
#. Install MPF dependencies if you did not install mpf before. On linux you can
   run our installer `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missionpinball/mpf-debian-installer/dev/install-mpf-dependencies`.
   On other platforms check the :doc:`installation instructions </install/index>` instructions.
#. Run ``pip3 install -e .`` from within the mpf folder to install MPF in editable
   mode.
#. Clone your fork of the mpf-mc repo to your local machine (``git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE/mpf-mc/``;
   only needed for media controller changes - skip otherwise).
#. Install MPF-MC dependencies if you did not install mpf-mc before. On linux
   you can run our installer `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missionpinball/mpf-debian-installer/dev/install-mc-dependencies`.
   On other platforms check the :doc:`installation instructions </install/index>` instructions.
#. Run ``pip3 install -e .`` from within the mpf-mc folder to install MPF MC in
   editable mode (only needed for media controller changes - skip otherwise and
   just run ``pip3 install mpf-mc --pre``).
#. Switch both repositories to the branch corresponding to the version you want
   to work with. This should be ``dev`` in most cases or the current release
   for smaller bug fixed. Do what works best for you. We can help to forward or
   backport your changes.
#. Create a local branch to work on (``git checkout -b your_feature_name``).
#. Make your changes.
#. Add your name to the ``AUTHORS`` file.
#. If possible add an unit test. We can help with that and a first Pull Request
   without a test is definitely fine.
#. Run ``python3 -m unittest discover -s mpf.tests`` and check that all tests
   still pass. You achieve the same for mpf-mc with ``python3 -m unittest discover -s mpfmc.tests``.
#. Commit your changes (``git commit -a``)
#. Push your changes to your github (``git push origin your_feature_name``).
#. Create and submit your pull request on github.

We recommend you to use a decent IDE because it makes life easier.
Most of the MPF developers use PyCharm but other IDEs will work as well.


Getting started with an open issue
----------------------------------

We maintain a list of issues which are self-contained and good to solve on
their own without too much interaction with core code. We label those as 
`help wanted <https://github.com/missionpinball/mpf/labels/help%20wanted>`_
(although they do not have to be easy, just self-containted). If you want
to work on one of them (or any other issue) comment on the issue or write
in the forum and we will assist you along the way.
