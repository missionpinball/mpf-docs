Creating your own modes
=======================

Our step-by-step tutorial walks you through creating your own game modes. We
just include this page on creating your own modes so you don't read the list
of built-in modes and think that's all MPF can do. :)

Also if you haven't read the overview of :doc:`how modes work in MPF <index>`, do that now.
We documented the general approach to design a game in the
:doc:`Game Design </game_design/index>` section.
