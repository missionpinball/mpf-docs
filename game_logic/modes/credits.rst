Credits (mode)
==============

MPF includes a complete credits mode that can be used to
enable tracking credits and taking money. See the How To: Add Coins &
Credits guide for details of how to set it up.

The credits mode is highly-configurable, including pricing per game,
currencies, price tiering ($0.50 for 1 credit, $2.00 for 5, etc.),
credit expiration, etc.

See :doc:`/game_logic/credits/index` for details.
