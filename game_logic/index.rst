Game Logic
==========

Most (potentially all) of your game logic can be configured in the MPF
config files. For classical language programmers new to MPF, an introduction
to how the framework handles logical decisions may be helpful. All game logic
is tied to event posts. Mostly, this is achieved through config file programming
of timers, shots, counters, multiballs, accruals, etc....  These prebuilt 
modules (listed below) listen for events to be posted then read the state of the
hardware and/or perform manipulations on player or device variables. In turn
these modules issue their own event posts which drive the behavior or other 
modules and devices to start and stop modes, control diverts, set bonus 
multipliers and everything else game related.  

A question beginners may have is "How do I tell MPF to perform an action when 
two or more conditions are met simultaneously?" In an event driven framework
this is not the correct way to conseptualize the logic. Again, nothing game related 
happens without being driven by a posted event. Because events only exist as a 
descrete moments in time, it does not work to attempt (pseudocode) logic such as 
IF event1 and event2 then post event3. Nevertheless, MPF provides a flexible and 
robust mechanism for performing logic on events. This is where Conditional Events 
come in. 

In brief, the the way conditional events work is by telling MPF to process a 
particular event if and only if additional conditions are met. These conditions 
(listed inside curly brackets) can relate to player variables (such as score) 
machine variables (such as credit) or device variables (such as timer ticks 
or number of balls locked). See <conditional/index> for specific examples. 

With this flexibility in mind, Here is a list of pre-built game logic modules 
containing the description, how to guides, links to tutorials, event listings, 
and configuration

.. note:: Most of the "How To" guides for these sections still need to be written.
