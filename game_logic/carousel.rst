A carousel allows you to create process for the player to select from a list
of items such as selecting a mode to play.
The carousel is implemented as a mode.
The player can move through a list of items that you provide on the display
or cycle through playfield inserts.

This is just one way to select modes. More ways to implement mode selection
are described in the :doc:`mode selection section </game_design/mode_selection>`
of the :doc:`game design documentation </game_design/index>`.

A common use of the carousel is to create a mode selection process.
For example, the player can scroll through a list of modes on the display.
Each mode could be presented to the user as a slide.
The player can move from slide to slide using the flippers.
Once the player decides which mode to play, he can select the mode by hitting
the start button or both flippers at once.
This is just one example of how you could implement a carousel as a mode
selection process.

There is a reference to a code file in here so be careful to include that
reference.
You don't need to download any code as it is already in you MPF installation.
Here is the process of configuring a carousel:

* Create a mode folder and config file ``<machine>/modes/carousel/config/carousel.yaml``
* Add the code to ``mode:`` section:

.. code-block:: yaml

    code: mpf.modes.carousel.code.carousel.Carousel

* Create your selectable items.  These could be your mode names but you can name them anything for now.

.. code-block:: yaml

   selectable_items: terra, pyro, space, liquid

* Select the event(s) that choose the item.  For example, the start button. You could think of this an the "enter key"

.. code-block:: yaml

   select_item_events: s_start_active

* Select the event that moves to the next item in the list of items

.. code-block:: yaml

  next_item_events: s_right_flipper_active

* Select the event that moves back to the previous item in the list of items

.. code-block:: yaml

   previous_item_events: s_left_flipper_active


There are two events of importance here:

* carousel_<item>_highlighted
* carousel_<item>_selected

You can use the carousel_<item>_highlighted event to display a slide showing the name of the mode to the player.

You can then use the carousel_<item>_selected event to start the mode that was selected by the player.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

  ##! mode: my_carousel
  #config_version=5
  mode:
    start_events: ball_starting
    stop_events: carousel_terra_selected  # not sure what event to use here????
    code: mpf.modes.carousel.code.carousel.Carousel

  mode_settings:
    selectable_items: terra, pyro, space, liquid

Doctor Who Carousel
-------------------

The following example is based around Bally's Doctor Who.
When the player starts a game, the player is shown via a carousel the option to pick eight modes, each representing a
certain Doctor.
The flipper buttons control the carousel right and left.
When the Launch Button is pressed, the game starts the mode selected by the player and launches the ball.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    #config_version=5

    ##! mode: carousel
    # put this in your modes/carousel/config/carousel.yaml
    mode:
      start_events: ball_starting
      stop_events: carousel_Doctor1_selected, carousel_Doctor2_selected, carousel_Doctor3_selected, carousel_Doctor4_selected, carousel_Doctor5_selected, carousel_Doctor6_selected, carousel_Doctor7_selected, carousel_Doctor8_selected
      code: mpf.modes.carousel.code.carousel.Carousel
      priority: 125

    mode_settings:
      selectable_items: Doctor1, Doctor2, Doctor3, Doctor4, Doctor5, Doctor6, Doctor7, Doctor8
      select_item_events: sw_launch_active
      next_item_events: sw_right_flipper_active
      previous_item_events: sw_left_flipper_active

    slide_player:
      carousel_Doctor1_highlighted: select_Doctor1
      carousel_Doctor2_highlighted: select_Doctor2
      carousel_Doctor3_highlighted: select_Doctor3
      carousel_Doctor4_highlighted: select_Doctor4
      carousel_Doctor5_highlighted: select_Doctor5
      carousel_Doctor6_highlighted: select_Doctor6
      carousel_Doctor7_highlighted: select_Doctor7
      carousel_Doctor8_highlighted: select_Doctor8

    slides:
       select_Doctor1:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 1
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right
       select_Doctor2:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 2
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right
       select_Doctor3:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 3
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right
       select_Doctor4:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 4
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right
       select_Doctor5:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 5
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right
       select_Doctor6:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 6
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right
       select_Doctor7:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 7
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right
       select_Doctor8:
          widgets:
             - type: text
               text: Doctor 8
               font_size: 10
               color: yellow
               transition:
             - type: move_in
               direction: right

    event_player:
       select_Doctor1: mode_Doctor_1_start
       select_Doctor2: mode_Doctor_2_start
       select_Doctor3: mode_Doctor_3_start
       select_Doctor4: mode_Doctor_4_start
       select_Doctor5: mode_Doctor_5_start
       select_Doctor6: mode_Doctor_6_start
       select_Doctor7: mode_Doctor_7_start
       select_Doctor8: mode_Doctor_8_start

Then, each mode that the carousel can start is set up with the following.

.. code-block:: mpf-config

    #config_version=5

    ##! mode: Doctor_1
    ##Example:  Doctor_1.yaml

    mode:
       start_events: carousel_Doctor1_selected
       stop_events: ball_ended
       priority: 130

    ##Then the rest of the mode's code.
